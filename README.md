This repository contains the source code for our Paper: [MENLI: Robust Evaluation Metrics from Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07316).

## Machine Translation
Run [experiments.ipynb](https://github.com/cyr19/MENLI/blob/main/experiments/experiments.ipynb) to reproduce all the results for MT. Before that, download the stored metric scores from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11ucw-Rgyj5G8TJ1KxNowAfnQjCnyKtv2/view?usp=sharing) and upzip it to results/ folder.

## Todo 
1. summarization
2. evaluation scripts
3. Creation pipeline for Adversarial datasets
