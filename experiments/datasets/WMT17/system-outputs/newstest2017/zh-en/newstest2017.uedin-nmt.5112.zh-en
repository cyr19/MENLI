28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to harm him and said that "everything is finally getting better."
The San Francisco coroner's office said the body found at West Midlands Shopping Centre on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and is under investigation.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's San Francisco-based radio station KGO that Frank, who previously worked as a line cook in Boston, found an ideal job as a line cook at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said they were "very shocked" by Frank's death.
"We are a small team with a close-knit family, and we will miss him deeply," the spokesman said.
At this sad time, we express our deep sympathy and condolences to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said Frank lived in the guest house at first, but recently "everything is finally getting better."
Louis Galicia told KGO: "Frank found an apartment and was dating a girl at the same time."
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to harm his brother.
Frank has a good heart and a broad mind.
"Frank often cooks dinner for the family," Louis Galicia said.
He was never willing to quarrel with his family.
He was a man who followed everyone's opinion.
"Everything in the world has the potential to go wrong," says Louis Galicia, "but Frank is a man who shines every day."

Junior doctors' strike: Call for new Labour action
Junior doctors' representatives have called on the Coalition to approve its new labour action in response to the new contract dispute.
The British Medical Association's junior doctors committee will require all its members to support more labour action since early September.
The junior doctors committee said ministers had failed to address concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to boycott a contract deal with the British Medical Association.
Of the members who participated in the vote, 58 per cent opposed the contract deal.
The chairman of the junior doctors committee, Ellen McCourt, said in a letter to members published on Twitter late Thursday that the government had been "consistently silent" on issues that led to the contract being resisted.
"In light of this, the executive committee of the junior doctors' committee has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and call for a renewed formal consultation on all concerns," she said.
In response to the government's silence, the junior doctors' committee executive committee has today formally asked the British Medical Association Council to convene a special session to approve a long-term plan to upgrade Labour's operations from early September.
The dispute has led junior doctors to take part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out strike in NHS history.
Dr Johann Malawana, leader of junior doctors at the British Medical Association, resigned after the British Medical Association's proposed contract agreement was met with a vote boycott.
In a meeting before the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students, he told members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should be accepted.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be enforced by paramedics in England.
Russia vs. Turkey: "Out of coalition"?
A gesture to end a crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce a formal end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish president in the glittering hall of a St Petersburg palace, I had a strong feeling that this reconciliation was what Ankara would most like to see.
Yes, the two sides did shake hands.
Yet, even by the standards of Mr. Putin's usual introspection, Mr. Putin has only a shallow smile, with little enthusiasm.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan reportedly mentioned "good friend" Putin five times.
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia would return to pre-crisis levels, even to a higher level.
The next day, the newspaper wrote that Mr. Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
But I think his enthusiasm suggests something to the contrary.
Yet Mr. Putin's continued nonchalance suggests that he has forgotten nothing.
Indeed, the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow reacted furiously at the time.
Mr Putin lashed out at the incident, accusing Ankara of hacking Moscow in the back.
Attacks from so-called friends are even more difficult to accept.
It is difficult, if not impossible, to re-establish real trust.
There has also been a reversal in Russian public opinion since it began in November.
For months, the government-controlled media carried out a shocking full-blown attack on Ankara.
All of a sudden, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
Among the most serious are accusations from senior officials that Mr. Erdogan's family is profiting from illegal oil deals in the so-called Islamic State-controlled Syrian region.
He has categorically denied that claim.
However, the news from St Petersburg showed that it was time to look ahead.
After all, the premise of the meeting was that Putin received an apology from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the truce are obvious.
First, Erdogan was nearly ousted after last month's failed coup, so he needed the support of all his friends.
The constant terrorist attacks have clearly taken a heavy toll on him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially by banning charter services that could transport millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The figure has fallen sharply by nearly 90 per cent.
As flights resume, Russian travel agencies and charter companies are bound to breathe a sigh of relief.
They will usher in the end-of-season Mediterranean tourism boom.
State television even predicted this week that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall once Turkish agricultural imports are re-released.
"The tourists went and the tomato came back," according to a report in the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti.
For Moscow, the visit also has extra political value.
Ankara has been angered by the Western world's weak response to takeover intentions.
Moreover, Ankara has long been unhappy with the slow progress in EU negotiations and Putin's involvement, and Putin is keen to take advantage of the political chill and weaken Turkey's ties with the West.
By embracing the elected authorities in the wake of the failed coup, the Russian leader will surely get a bonus point from Ankara.
Note that this is a gift for Moscow, which has been deeply fearful of regime change.
So the meeting held at this glittering seaside palace has led Russia and Turkey to form allies in a country that has been rejected and abused by the Western world, with one analyst describing it as "out of the league."
However, despite the public reconciliation, significant differences remain between the two sides.
Syria is one of the key factors, with Moscow playing the role of peacemaker in Syria in recent days, while Russia and Turkey support the opposite faction.
Predictably, after nearly three hours of preliminary conversation, the two presidents said at the launch that the topic had not been talked about.
The Turkish president has deliberately avoided questions about the differences between the two sides, which Mr Putin has stressed.
There is no clear consensus on how to seek common ground on Syria.
It would certainly be a good thing for the leaders of the two countries to restart dialogue after months of open hostilities and major disasters caused by the shooting down of Russian warplanes by Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
RBS will no longer serve customer services outside of Scotland
The bank will be simplified as a logistics unit, according to the RBS chief executive.
RBS will no longer serve customer service outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand had been committed to its global ambitions.
But eight years ago, it was on the verge of collapse, and had to be rescued from that pursuit since then.
During that time, brand strategists used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
The group has spent millions of pounds sponsoring international sporting events by sponsoring the Rugby Six Nations and Wimbledon tennis tournament champion Andy Murray.
But right now, the right thing to do is to bring more national brands to the fore.
RBS will be used for Scottish customers but will not return as it is.
In England and Wales, all references outside the headquarters and the stock exchange will be changed to National Westminster Bank.
The Ulster Bank brand has been used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and the autonomous region of Northern Ireland.
There are other, more prominent, smaller private banking brands, such as Couch Bank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a visit to Inverness County clients and staff.
He told BBC Scotland: "The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will end up being our investor brand, as well as being one of the staff hire brands, because at the moment we have become a bank with many brands."
As the bank itself became an international brand, RBS also became a global brand.
At the moment, I would like to say that we are no longer focused on the world, and we have turned our eyes to home.
Each brand represents the difference in their respective industries, and our employees work through different brands for customer service.
RBS has shown it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Championship; at the same time, efforts have been made to raise the profile of different brands in the sponsorship of sporting events.
"It's time to become a multi-brand bank, because in private we have been exploring how to be a better bank for our customers," the CEO said.
If we aspire to be a big bank with a lot of brands three years ago, it will be ridiculed.
At the moment we focus on customer needs, and I believe you have noticed these changes.
I think we can restart these brands, and the time is right now.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Theresa May has achieved a career-high 3,000 wins in a successful career at New Markit
Newmarkett's two victories helped him to a career-high 3,000 wins, after which he sprayed champagne to celebrate
Professional jockey Frankie Dettori scored his 3,000th victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He scored a career-high 3,000 wins on the night, picking up two victories in the course of the night, at the hands of his trainer, John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional jockey to reach this milestone in the flat field.
The top five were: Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pigott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion jockey, who earlier won at Ghayyar, said: "It's very special."
I was thrilled because my family was also on the scene
I'm happy with what I've achieved at Newmarckett since I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a massive Jockey Club or Royal Ascot, which is just an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 viewers.
I am very thankful and courteous.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Duterte led the pack after the win, prompting cheers from the crowd
In the slalom field, two jockeys achieved this achievement, respectively, by champion jockey Richard Johnson and now retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, in which Sir McCoy scored more than 4,300 victories in his record-breaking career.
Berge is a nine-time champion and has won a total of 4,493 victories in his career
He is one of the best jockeys of modern times, so it is not surprising that he has achieved this milestone, and there are not many people who have achieved it before.
He was stylish and strong, but what really made him stand out in the weighing room was his tactical nous.
He is a remarkable equestrian ambassador, and for many years his passion and charm has attracted a large number of fans to the sport.
I said in Epsom a few weeks ago that if he wasn't just a weekend with the big race jockey, he should have been able to get 6,000 wins!
Seriously, it is too important for Dai to be the best equestrian winner in the UK for three decades.
He has a lively personality, which is good for British horse racing, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption DeGeneres celebrated the milestone with its iconic jump-down horse move
From the jump-line to the jump-down horse, for two decades, Dai has been a typical representative of the field in the UK.
His career is like a roller coaster.
He won several major championships, including a famous "seven-game winning streak" at the Royal Ascot Jockey Club in 1996, but he also suffered a crash and was banned for doping.
It was a struggle three years ago, when he returned to the game after a six-month ban, but he showed amazing character and finally got back to the top, giving the doubters a head start.
He may not be able to do it for too long - he has previously said he hopes to compete at least until the age of 50.
Russian President Vladimir Putin removes Sergei Ivanov's chief of staff
Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov, the president's chief of staff.
For years, Mr. Ivanov has been a part of the core group that Mr. Putin trusted.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
A Kremlin statement said that Mr. Putin had "announced the removal of Ivanov's chief of staff of the Russian president," but did not give a reason.
Anton Vaino, who started as Mr Ivanov's deputy in 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr. Levino, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, and graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo embassy.
Later, he managed the presidential draft and government employees, the Kremlin website (in Russian) said.
After his appointment, he said of Mr. Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of this Government is to support the Head of State in the drafting of laws and control directives.
Mr. Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself had called for his resignation and recommended Mr. Waitano to take over himself.
Is such a smile convincing?
Moscow was puzzled by the move.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Putin's closest aides and, like Putin, has worked at the Soviet Security Service (KGB).
As chief of staff, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
In a meeting with President Vladimir Putin on state television, both said the chief of staff had called for his resignation.
Despite all smiles in front of the camera, few were convinced - especially at this time before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of a fall in some kind of power struggle?
It has not been known.
But the official narrative - that a man once seen as a candidate for president has suddenly chosen to take the helm of Russia's environmental policy - has attracted a lot of skepticism.
The Kremlin website quoted Mr. Ivanov's conversation with Mr. Putin, saying: "Yes, in early 2012, I asked you in a conversation to give me this difficult position, or even a troubled position, for a four-year term."
"As a result, I have been director of the Office of the President for four years and eight months."
Mr. Ivanov assumed the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Mr. Putin, is a former member of the National Security Agency.
In the late 1990s, when Mr. Putin became head of the Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly the National Security Agency), Mr. Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Mr. Putin came to power, he designated Mr. Ivanov as one of the five people he most trusted.
It was once thought that Mr. Ivanov might serve as President of Russia after Mr. Putin's second term, because a third term would be unconstitutional.
But the post ultimately belonged to Dmitry Medvedev, another close aide to Putin.
Before re-serving as president three and a half years later, Mr. Putin served as Russia's prime minister.
Mystery fish surprises Banff a garden
A resident of Banff found fish in his garden and asked for help.
Kevin Bain believes the 75 fish may have been seared by a tornado at sea.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a video of the bizarre scene on Periscope in the hope that someone could explain for him why the two-inch-long fish would appear.
The Kunsferrie Bridge is now in Fife
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017
Engineers have linked the northern deck of the Queenferry Bridge to the viaduct, meaning the bridge is now in Fife.
Located near the three bridges of each bridge, the "deck fan" is now close to completion, and the project is headed for a long bridge.
The bridge, which started in Fife, is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 metric tons.
It uses 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 cable cables.
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the scene today and became one of the first people to board the bridge.
"This is a historic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Bridge," he said.
We have all witnessed engineering work on such a grand project, using more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel in this section of the bridge.
Although the size and weight of the bridge is enormous, the completion of the viaduct and the bridge between the decks requires fine operations and a very precise assembly.
Overall, nearly 79 per cent of the total deck has now been installed, and the concrete deck of the last part of the deck is being poured in Royth today, meaning all the decks are ready.
Michael Martin, project director of the Queanbeyan Bridge Construction Company, said: "No matter which bridge project, the first time Geelong is a major milestone."
As far as this remarkable project is concerned, the dragon shows the cutting edge of civil engineering technology.
After installing the final panel and connecting it to the expanded Northbridge Road panel, you will need to complete the remaining gaps on the north side or near the land side.
The completion of the operation involves the transfer of 700 mm south of the overhead bridge to the north.
It was a huge operation and a very sophisticated operation at the same time.
It's huge because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 metric tons and needs to pull out a slope of about 3 percent.
It's precise because the engineering team needs to make sure the deviation is very small, with only a few millimetres on each side.
It is reassuring that everything is going well.
Simon Biles wins women's gymnastics all-time title
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is not immune to all of this.
It's full of energy when you jump a horse.
There's more on the balance beam.
The floor exercise was stunning.
The overall performance was brilliant.
Now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast, who won the All-Pro title on Thursday, fully demonstrated her talent for leading the world in gymnastics at the Olympic Games.
She finished with a total score of 62.198, with silver medallist Ally Raisman and bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina.
Simon Byers from the United States performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-round final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles helped the U.S. team to a four-match winning streak in women's gymnastics at the Olympics, and she has won five medals at the Olympics, further confirming that she is a generation and probably the best gymnast of all time.
The moment he saw his total score, Byers couldn't help but shed tears. She finally ended the long journey.
Biles thus ranks among the "decades-old athletes" like Michael Phelps, who have elevated the sport in their respective fields to new heights:
"Biles is the best gymnast I've ever seen," said Mary Lou Retton, the 1984 Olympic champion who has won 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold medals.
There is still a final game in Brazil, but the game is not so much a contest between Bayers and other gymnasts as her own and the pressure of great expectations.
If the Bears didn't go back to her home in Sprint, Texas, they would be very disappointed.
Simon Biles (left), from the United States, cuddles with Lesman, who won gold and silver in the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-round final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, Aug.
Biles won his first gold medal on Tuesday, giving a surprise tribute to retiring national team coach Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insists that he did not plan for the future in the years leading up to the title, it is not entirely true.
A section of the Bears' floor exercise - including the one with her signature churning string - matched Latin music, which she often listened to in a single street from the Rio Olympic venues.
This is no coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by grandparents during her infant years and was spotted by coach Amy Boorman during a gym field trip, has now grown into the backbone.
The Bears haven't lost in the all-round game since the summer of 2013, and as long as they want to win, she is sure to win.
Moustavana's slight lead after two spins was just an illusion.
Bayer, the reigning world champion in the balance beam and freestyle gymnastics, is waiting.
Her balance beam scored 15.433, with free gymnastics scoring 15.933.
While waiting for the final score to come out, Lesman gave the Bears a gentle hug, and when Biles learned of his dream performance, he was left in tears.
Lesman's performance was a bit like the revenge of four years ago, when she tied for third, but lost in the decider to Moothafina.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, dubbed "Granny" by the Americans, was ahead of her.
She kisses the crowd at the end of the floor exercise and announces a return, but such a return sometimes seems to be in doubt.
Biles is only 19 years old, and since earlier this week, the news has gone viral. In the case of Biles, his life has been given a whole new meaning.
6-year-old Mahaj Brown spared jail in Philadelphia shootings
A six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old child in the city this week, police said.
The child's grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child who was shot was Mahaj Brown.
They said Brown had multiple gunshot wounds to his groin, legs, arms and abdomen, but the child was conscious on the way to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, and the little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the television station.
I couldn't believe it.
The boy is in a critical condition in hospital and has undergone multiple surgeries.
His family told the television station that the child was expected to recover.
He was to start his first grade at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Of the three others who were shot, two were 29 years old and one was 32 years old.
One of the 29-year-old victims was in critical condition; the other two victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found with the 29-year-old victim in the front seat of the car, the station said.
Two other victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether a gunman was among the injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like multiple gunmen exchanged gunfire.
A number of shell casings of assault weapons were found at the scene and it was assumed that they were using different assault weapons.
Judging from this, there is no doubt that this is an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on the sidewalks on both sides of the street.
"So there were multiple armed men at the scene," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
A number of houses and vehicles were damaged in the area.
No arrests have yet been carried out, and police are said to be watching surveillance video.
On Tuesday, there was also a six-year-old (girl) who was shot in the arm while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is currently recovering and police are still pursuing the suspect.
Why we need Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie
That's how I rated this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team for more than one reason.
First of all, since 1984, I have gone to every Summer Olympics, but the United States has never been so dominant.
Second, the gymnastics team has three elite gymnasts - Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, who have been inspiring many girls of color.
The composition of the team is a source of great pride to all, because it contains Ali Raisman of Judaism and Madison Kocian of the Catholic Church.
The team finally looked like the American team.
It also cemented the peak status of black and Latino women in the sport.
The leading female gymnast has been African-American for the past four years.
Last year, Simon and Gabrielle split first and second.
This is so bad.
The last Olympic Games, in which Gabrielle Douglas "unexpectedly" became the Olympic champion, cheered the United States.
Today, the world can witness the brilliant performances of three-time world champions Simon Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez.
On Thursday, Simon helped the U.S. team to a four-match winning streak in the women's individual all-round event.
Her team-mate, Ali Lesman, won the silver medal.
We got to the top of the sport, but not in the national gymnastics teaching class.
Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie entered the Olympic team in the same way as Ali and Madison.
They are the Final Five, because the next Olympic gymnastics team will be made up of four gymnasts, which Marta Karolyi coached in the last year.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, with gymnasts trained mainly in private gymnastics clubs, whose parents need to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (including coaches and gymnasts and family members), and the list of costs is increasing.
Most of the gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburbs that can support the industry.
All training for gymnasts is done at these clubs, a long-term expensive expense for the gymnasts' families.
Bayers coach Aimee Boorman and Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have coached them since the two gymnasts began to practice gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to countless young girls who have been influenced by Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie.
Twenty years ago, I set up my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we offer free, cheap gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly blacks and Hispanics) in black residential areas, and develop national and even world champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this learning opportunity and will benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
It helps to develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body. It also helps to foster a spirit of preparedness, self-discipline and determination.
These can bring life-long benefits to a person's health, education and success at work.
Inspired by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in sports is significant, especially for girls.
It's an exciting time.
Thanks to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabrielle and Madison for their wonderful "girl power" in winning Olympic group gold, and for inspiring young girls of diverse backgrounds to open the way to health, strength, and success.
Junior doctors plan to launch further strikes after dismissing Jeremy Hunt proposal
Ministers initially hoped to end the change-induced dispute by accepting a revised contract from the British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors involved in the vote opposed the contract.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract, saying the NHS was currently in a "vacuum zone" and that a slight delay would harm the interests of staff and patients.
The new contract first referred to changes to junior doctors' overnight and weekend working practices to improve care for irregular working hours.
Last night, Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's junior doctors committee, said in a statement: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract and are particularly concerned that it will exacerbate the current labour crisis and treat all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks to go before the first doctors sign a new contract, we need to make progress and time is running out.
The BMA works to resolve disputes through negotiations, but everyone is reluctant to participate, and sometimes the government responds in silence.
Still, just last month we got a promise from Jeremy Hunt, who said his door was always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now to remove the enforcement and address the concerns of junior doctors," it said.
If he does not, junior doctors have made it clear they are ready for further labour action.
The last strike, which took place at the end of April, resulted in nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments postponed as nurses and consultation doctors took cover for doctors on the picket line.
Ministers initially hoped to end the change-induced dispute by accepting the BMA's revised contract.
The BMA wants to secure better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract.
NHS Emplers chief executive Daniel Mortimer has called on junior doctors not to stage any further strikes.
Mr Mortimer said: "Labour actions have had little effect, but instead put pressure on the already concentrated teams and services, leading to concern, anxiety and confusion among patients, paramedics and their families."
Over the past two months, we have been in constant negotiations with the junior doctors' committee and, together with the Department of Health and other departments, have actively responded to their concerns about the role of the Guardian and the reporting of whistleblowing.
Employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics - such as deployment, training flexibility, other training for those who are on duty after a career interruption, training costs, common perceptions of course outlines, study leave and the gender pay gap in the medical field, which are important to the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
£2-a-day drug could reduce heart attack threat
Officials recommend extending a £2-a-day drug to more patients and extending the duration of the medication, after which thousands of heart patients will benefit from the drug.
Anti-clotting drugs can reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence in patients with heart disease.
The drug, which lasts for 12 months after a heart attack, can reduce the risk of another stroke or heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), the regulator of the NHS, has advised patients to continue taking medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of heart vascular disease.
But now, NHS regulator NICE recommends giving patients sustained medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of heart vascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease each year, and a quarter of them continue to experience a recurrence of heart disease or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty substances forming plaques in the walls of the arteries.
If the plaque is disconnected, it can lead to clots, which in turn impede the flow of blood into the heart, leading to a heart attack.
If the clot moves, it goes into the bloodstream, blocking the flow of blood into the brain, leading to a stroke.
Patients who have already experienced a heart attack have a higher risk of having a heart attack again.
It is manufactured by AstraZeneca, a British company, and marketed under the name Brilique, which reduces the risk of disease by reducing the formation of clots.
The draft NICE guidance issued today recommends that patients take 90 mg for a 12-month period, after which they take 60mg and two aspirin a day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the Centre for Health Technology Assessment at NICE, said: "Despite effective secondary prevention treatment, up to a quarter of patients with a history of heart attacks will have another onset or stroke, often with serious consequences."
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The evidence suggests that taking aspirin together with aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in patients who have experienced a heart attack.
It is a great relief to us that the interim recommendation of Mr CarGray will provide more treatment options for the thousands of people who have benefited.
The draft guidance does not recommend the continuation of treatment after this period, given the limited information on the efficacy and safety, especially the risk of bleeding, after three years.
Computer culture makes "electoral fraud" prevalent in Muslim areas
Lutfur Rahman, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was sacked last year for corruption, prompting the publication of a government report.
The "political correctness" culture has turned a blind eye to widespread electoral fraud in the Muslim community, a devastating government report reveals today.
Sir Eric Pickles, a former cabinet minister, accused the police, election regulator and town hall of turning a blind eye to evidence of an abuse of the election because of "over-sensitivity to racial divisions and religious issues."
The former minister of community affairs and current anti-corruption campaigner said the use of religious positions to intimidate voters was bad, and that police should be allowed to set up cordons outside polling stations as a way to protect frightened voters.
He suggested that voters carry identity papers when they vote to confirm their identity.
At present, voters simply have to give their own name and address.
The report even suggests putting an indelible ink on a voter's finger to prevent someone from voting twice.
Sir Eric said there should be greater protection for whistleblowers.
He called for increased media access to parliamentary documentation and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not just to guard against electoral fraud, or to protect local governments from the widespread culture of corruption and the poisoning of financial scams that are closely linked to them," he said.
The report comes after Downing Street called for it to be issued in the wake of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special electoral tribunal ruled that there was a string of corruption and violations committed by the incumbent mayor, Rahman, and should be dismissed.
The tribunal found that Rahman had "very ridiculously abused" the religious feelings of the Muslim community and closed his mouth to allegations that the sword referred to him as racist and Islamophobic.
Rahman is said to have "claimed at the time of the campaign that voting for him was a religious duty of loyal Muslims."
As many as 300 votes are in doubt, and it may be that voters fake the votes of others.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of electoral fraud across the country.
He specifically warned of electoral fraud by mail, and senior members of the Muslim community are said to have put pressure on voters to cast ballots for their designated candidates.
Sir Eric (pictured) has made several proposals to clean up the voting mechanism, including the identification of identity documents to confirm their identity
"The evidence suggests that senior members, particularly in Pakistani and Bangladeshi background communities, have put pressure on vulnerable groups in some minority communities, especially women and young people, to vote as they wish," he said in the report.
"Because of the oversensitivity to racial division and religious" political correctness, "they fear that state institutions will turn a blind eye to such behavior."
Sir Eric has put forward 50 proposals to clean up the election mechanism, including a ban on political activists handling postal voting documents to stop "vote harvesting."
The report also calls for strict registration of information to prevent voter rolls from being used for immigration and welfare scams, Theresa May is also considering the report.
The proposals include requiring voters to show their identity documents before they vote.
After the vote, apply an indelible ink on the voter's finger to prevent someone from voting twice.
Systematic verification of voters' ethnic affiliation to ensure eligibility to vote.
The period of validity of a request for an automatic postal vote is set at three years.
Political activists and activists are banned from handling completed postal ballots and postal voting envelopes.
Police are authorized to set up a cordon around the polling station.
The amendment of the provisions of the law made it easier to accuse persons of intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983.
It is illegal to take photos at polling stations.
Provision is made for the use of English only at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff strictly enforce the requirement that "voters go to the voting hall alone."
Sir Eric lashed out at the Metropolitan Police, saying they were "surprised" that they had not made any criminal charges following the incident at Tower Hamlets.
"There has been a lot of corruption and violations by Rahman and his election officers, and as a result they have been disqualified by the Electoral Tribunal," he said.
In accordance with the standard of criminal proof, he is undoubtedly guilty in many respects.
He also criticized the "marquee check" of the town hall's election registration department.
Sir Eric said: "The tribunal's verdict on Tower Hamlets last year was a wake-up call for everyone."
Our country has a glorious tradition of "the mother of parliament," yet it is a source of concern and a threat to this good reputation that some agencies have privately sneaked election fraud and the aftermath.

This week, Pauline Ferrand Prevot, the French cyclist who looks like Princess Kate at the 2016 Rio Olympics, has been heavily courted by viewers.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is not the only gold-medal contender for a face-to-face celebrity at this summer's Olympics, at least on social media.
So, to mark the Rio Olympics with all the celebrity faces that appeared on screen at the time, FEMAIL compiled a list of Olympians who hit face-to-face Hollywood stars.
Hunters and wolves: American men's archery team Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
Many netizens were quick to discover that an archer was simply the twin brother of Leonardo DiCaprio.
American men's archer Brady Ellison has caused a huge stir on social media since his resemblance to the "Wolf of Wall Street" model came to light on Twitter.
In fact, the archer was aware of the hype on social media and admitted that he looked like a little plum.
"I don't think it looks like anything other than a beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking playboy, so I think it's a compliment to me."
One of the most popular contrasts at the London 2012 Olympics will no doubt find more similarities this year: British long jumper Greg Rutherford looks like the famous actor Neil Patrick Harris.
A pair of big-eyed Russian gymnasts, Aliya Mustafina, is referred to as Gloria Estefan, a Cuban-American pop star.
And in the swimming pool, for years, Cameron van der Burgh, a South African swimmer, has been brought in to make comparisons with "Glee" star Matthew Morrison.
Change: The user thought that Nathan Adrian was the "sporty version" of the "Inception" actor
Another pair who are old to be compared are tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, whose thick eyebrows and lips look alike.
Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova, who won the silver medal, and the actor Annalyne McCord have the same antique skin and blonde hair, while Team USA's Ni Jia has been likened by fans to a "sporty version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt."
Female men: Football stars Hope Solo (left) and bloodthirsty forensic actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar faces and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was happy to discover that others saw the similarities too
Spread theory: According to the user, the pair may be looking for a reason
One Twitter user recently happily claimed online that "other netizens also think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look alike."
It was true that the American soccer star and the bloodthirsty forensic scientist had a very similar face and eyes.
Other popular contrasts include Kerri Walsh Jennings, who has a smile almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney; and Gabby Douglas, the gold-medal-winning gymnast, with a beautiful and bright smile like Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics announcer apologizes for comments about Chinese swimmers "as slow as pigs"
Byron MacDonald's comments on Wednesday that the 14-year-old won the 4x200m freestyle relay in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay angered viewers watching the live broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)
A commentator for CBC, a Canadian broadcaster, said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer would "swim faster than the stench" in the race and ended up being "as slow as a pig," after which the CBC was forced to apologise.
Commentator Byron McDonald made some of his own remarks at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final when he thought his microphone had been switched off.
"The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake," said Byron, a CBC commentator.
Because he was so excited, he started to swim faster than the stench, but then it was as slow as a pig.
It's really thanks to her.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was second best with a time of 1: 57 seconds, trailing Canada's Taylor Ruck by 1.61 seconds, leading the Canadian team to close the gap with China.
The entire Canadian audience was struck by the tone and wording of the narrator, who then reacted quickly online
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: 'That CBC narrator says China's 14-year-old swimmer is' slow like a pig '???
The idiot didn't realise it was being broadcast live.
"The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake," said Ai Yan, who took part in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
Twitter's criticism of Byron MacDonald quickly went viral on Twitter, with many demanding its exit from the commentary.
When Twitter users heard that Byron MacDonald was unresponsive, they didn't stop there.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow # Byron MacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and your words and deeds make us all sound like a bunch of racists.
Soon after, CBC radio host Scott Russel apologised for Byron's remarks in a live broadcast, saying: "We apologise for the comments made by the live swimmers."
"We are sorry for this anachronistic wording."
CBC apologised more than 90 times to Twitter users who responded to the comment
Another commentator, Scott Russel, also apologized on behalf of Byron
CBC later posted a copy of their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who protested against Byron
The channel also quickly issued an apology and issued a statement.
We are extremely sorry to say that and live it out.
Last night, we moved quickly to apologise to viewers who tuned in to our live broadcast and to our viewers on social media.
What needs to be said is that Byron's commentary was aimed at the swimmers' performance, but not against her personally.
That is to say, the wording is really inappropriate, and Byron is deeply sorry.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast, saying his words meant no personal attacks and tried to justify his remarks.
"I want to take a moment to apologize for the remarks I made last night at the end of the women's relay race," he said on the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I'm just commenting on the performance of the swimmers, not against their individuals," he said.
"Of course, I don't mean no disrespect, I'm sorry," he said.
Primark customers expressed their anger at a woman who brazenly tried to try on his underpants in the middle of the store
A woman undressed in the middle of a Primark store, where customers did not know where to look.
To make matters worse, she also looked at how she looked, and then took off her underwear and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelves and eventually tried on four underpants in the store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The woman kept on trying on his underpants at the Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone and then put it back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson (mother of two children), who was also in the store at the time, said that after trying on the underwear, the mystery woman "got dressed again and went out of the store and didn't buy anything."
"People couldn't believe what they saw," she said.
She just stood in the middle of the store, took a pair of underpants off the shelf, took off her leggings and knickers, and put it on.
'she didn't try to find a hidden place to try it on - she just stood there and was really cheeky. '
"Everyone was stunned when she took her underpants off again, and apparently she wasn't satisfied because she put her underpants back on the shelf," she said.
After that, she tried three things like this, and found that she didn't like it, and then got dressed again and walked out of the store.
'she didn't seem to care that someone was looking at her - or didn't think about who would end up buying the underwear she tried to cross. '
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the town of Kent, said: 'It was disgusting to think that someone would buy the underwear that someone else went through and wasn't washed.'
It happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: 'As soon as she left, it was clear the shop assistant was going to make a tackle on these underpants, thankfully.'
"I hated buying a new pair of underwear, but I found another woman trying to get through and didn't get washed."
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark has been made aware of what happened on 9 August (Tuesday) in our Folkestone store."
All the problematic commodities have been laid down.
How to use Marcella to protect himself in a gun attack
The world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail.com might give you a sense of security.
We asked Rheon Mizrachi, the master of the Kav Maga Federation in New York, to find out how to respond to the gunmen at close range.
Whether he is from the front or behind you, the video will teach you how to win.
Mizrachi said that if the gunman approached you from behind, the first thing you had to do was turn around so you could see the attacker and "clear the line of fire."
Next, pinch the gun with the forearm and shoulder, then hit the attacker in the face with your elbow.
Next with a knee to his groin, when the attacker was bent over in pain, reversing the gun in his hand, hitting him in the face with a barrel and a reserve gun, keeping the weapon straight at him.
If the shooter approaches from the front and uses a similar technique - keeping your body out of the line of fire, seizing the gun and reversing the muzzle so that the gunman can't fire.
At the same time, put the weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest and reverse the muzzle from his clenched hand and point the gun at him.
Sounds complicated?
Check out the video to see how Mizrachi did it.
But remember, if you're not a maestro, the safest way to get out of a robbery is to hand over cash.
The family of a rogue family who destroyed a low-rent house in Sortash, Cornwall, before being evicted
A family of hooligans who have been evicted from their homes for intimidating neighbours has broken down on their low-rent homes before leaving, resulting in a £50,000 loss.
After a long list of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, were driven out of a low-rent house in Sortash, Cornwall.
After being forcibly removed from the residence, housing association officials were surprised to find that it had been severely damaged.
The walls were full of holes, the floor was torn, the rubbish was strewn all over the floor, and the walls were covered in a mess.
The family has been moving since the eviction and is said to be currently living in a private home
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at the Cornwall Housing Association, said she feared the house could not be saved.
"It's a nightmare for people who live here, and I don't think people can live like this," she said.
There's a lot to weigh up now, because the house is likely to be a not-so-good element in Cornwall.
The family are notorious and their names are equally notorious.
The couple, who have three sons, will live here from time to time, and police said the family's horror included using baseball bats to fight in the streets, terrorising nearby residents, drug use, drug trafficking, shouting, bickering and swearing.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant, named Skeldon, received an anti-social behaviour resolution.
In the house, which is likely to be demolished, many of the rooms have been litter for a long time
The floor was raised in the room where the drug had been traded
Neighbours said they were often seen fighting in the streets and often called the police
The Cornwall Housing Association forcibly removed her and her husband from the house this week after giving them an 11-week extension to remove them voluntarily.
At last the relieved neighbors cheered, saying that life had been hell.
"They don't care about anyone," one neighbour said.
We have lived next door to them for 20 years and have been so bad.
We have seen the police on numerous occasions.
"This morning, we couldn't sleep," he said.
We got up early because it's so quiet here - we're not used to it yet!
It's great that they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, community executive manager of the Cornwall Housing Association, said the family did not work well with the local government.
The family lived in the house for 20 years and the police visited regularly
Rubbish and old toys were dumped on the overgrown side of the low-rent house
He added: "It is regrettable that the tenant did not take any responsibility for her conduct with her family and the eviction was the last considered practice of the Cornwall Housing Association."
This is a very difficult case because of the extreme nature of their actions, and what they are doing must be a source of great fear to the neighbours.
I thank my team for the work they have done, as well as the community members of Devon and Cornwall Police and the community who have bravely provided us with information.
I hope the move will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that we have no tolerance for anti-social behaviour.
Mr Fitzpatrick said their three sons had lived in the house at various times, but also said they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress was also thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms after they were removed
Housing association workers will soon clean up piles of rubbish around the house
In 2014, police had searched the house, found 70 dock cannabis, and also found scales, drug paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of Class B drugs and drug trafficking.
She claims the money was used to buy a headstone for Lee Skeldon, the son who died in a car crash in 2013.
It is understood that after becoming homeless, Tanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of the house were covered with graffiti.
Police said they would expel the tenant who defied the tenant rules.
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to defy tenant rules.
"This warning is aimed at people who think their actions are not to blame, as well as those who are devastated by this behaviour," she said.
Devon and Cornwall Police do not tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour and they will continue to work together to protect our communities.
Reid: Hillary if elected president will nominate Garland to the Supreme Court
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said he was sure that if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was elected president, she would nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked confirmation of Garland since President Barack Obama nominated Garland in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the next president would choose the man to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a conference call Thursday that he predicted Hillary would choose Garland "with some credibility."
A spokeswoman for Reid then said Reid had made no comment on whether he would nominate Garland to speak directly with Hillary, and said he was only guessing.
He heaped praise on Garland and said Hillary's team did not want to be "stirred up" by the new candidate.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said the Republicans who blocked Garland's nomination were the "courtiers" and "achievers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is unfit to be president.
"Treats": The nude calendar "both men and women love"
The Treats magazine will join hands with photographer David Bellemere for a set of inspiration from the 1970s Pirelli calendar for 2017.
This time, they plan to look for a new generation of top models for their 2017 NU Musses calendar, rather than the famous nude.
Steve Shaw, president of Treats, said earlier this year that their nude-dominated magazine was different from the old-school Playboy because "the latter is oriented towards men."
And we are oriented towards women.
Obviously, he thinks the same is true of this set of calendars.
"We need to show the timeless and classic nudity that makes women and men feel comfortable, and this time it's inspired," Shaw said at a calendar launch.
Women will be happy to be involved in the shoot because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or go to open recruitment sites in Los Angeles and New York.
Small head sleeping shark is longest-lived vertebrate, video report reveals

Julius Nielsen, who has been studying the shark, said it has been documented that a female microcephaly shark is expected to be between 272 and 512 years old, with a body length of five metres.
French court rejects petition to demolish shops in Jungle camp
A French court has rejected a petition by the Calais government to dismantle dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the "Jungle" refugee camp, which currently houses thousands of refugees.
At the court's hearing this week, the Calais government argued that the French government should have the power to dismantle a total of 72 makeshift shops in the camp, selling goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offering haircuts, and selling tea at 50 cents (40p) in makeshift restaurants and selling basic meals for a few euros.
The Calais governor's office believes these places should be demolished because they are a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and there are also fire and health hazards.
Humanitarian groups have indicated to the Court that these shops and restaurants are of great importance, as the free food provided by State-backed associations and other groups simply does not meet the needs of the growing number of refugees in the camp.
They say these makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the operators of the 72 temporary shops, but said the governor's concerns were "entirely understandable."
Judge Jean François Molla said the role of these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants goes far beyond simply providing food to refugees who are "living in extremely dangerous conditions."
These places, he said, are a quiet confluence of refugees and volunteers.
One of the demolition threats is the "Jungle Book Kids" cafe in the camp, which offers 200 food, English and French lessons a day and offers asylum advice to hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 170000 people have signed a petition to protect the cafe.
A letter to the Guardian wrote that closing the cafe "will be a catastrophe for these children (many children are only eight years old)."
The two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, predicted on Friday that the number of refugees in the Jungle camp had breached 9000, the highest level since the surge in refugee numbers in the summer.
"This 5000 yuan funding has solved my immediate needs," he said.
He received a letter of acceptance from the University of South China.
Just as she was worried about the cost of admission, on August 9, the county council gave her a $5000 grant in time.
In the past few days, more than 690 poor university students have been funded by the county authorities.
At the same time, the economic situation of families is particularly difficult, and also helps them to complete their education by organizing social donations.
With a financial self-financing of more than 2.5 million yuan ($2.5 million) this year, the financial sector has been able to break into the real-name bank cards of poor students.
"I thought my father had passed away, and my brother and I were out of college, and I didn't expect the county to solve the difficulties for us in time," she said gratefully.
As at 8 August, 13140 needy students had received more than 21 million yuan in the first half of this year.
All the poor students in the county have achieved the necessary help.
It was observed at the scene that a large container truck was moving in the fast lane under the command of the traffic police, the container fell on the green road, and a 2-centimetre-deep hole was thrown at the side of the road.
The NSW government announced on Sunday that it would spend A $200 million ($154 million) on the largest renovation of the famous Sydney Opera House since it was built.
The NSW government said the repairs would not change the shell-like shape of the Opera House.
The Sydney Opera House is one of Sydney's landmark buildings, designed by Danish architect Joann Utersson, which was built in 1973 and receives about 8 million visitors a year.
Rory Jeffs, general manager of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, believes the Sydney Opera House will borrow the makeover to become "one of the best music halls in the world."
A non-resident citizen who has resided in Beijing for more than six months and is eligible for legal and stable employment, legal stability and continuous attendance in Beijing may apply for a residence permit.
Recently, Beijing's "Provisional Regulations on Residence Permit" has been introduced, which means that the "temporary residence permit" will be upgraded to a "residence permit."
The shift from "temporary residence permits" to "residence permits" means Beijing will shift from "management" to multi-location services, the head of the department said.
Journalists today learned from the State Administration of Taxation that, as of the end of June this year, the tax authorities at all levels had published 2470 "blacklist" cases of tax violations.
It is understood that in July 2014, the State Administration of Taxation took the first step in the functions of the central government and, in conjunction with the Tax Credit Administration, published the "Measures for the Publication of Information on Major Tax Offences."
Not only the facts of the violation, the legal basis, the handling of the punishment will be published, but also the basic information of the offending party and the person responsible for the relevant intermediary will also be exposed to the "blacklist."
The government departments of quality inspection, finance and customs have also taken relevant disciplinary measures against the "blacklisted" parties.
"The credit repair mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of the tax credit system and the construction of the whole social credit system, which marks the development of the social credit system in China."
"Environmental problems are manifested in the atmosphere, water, soil pollution, but the root is still in the production lifestyle."
In 2015, for example, land development in Jiangsu Province was as high as 21%, the highest in the country's provinces and autonomous regions.
As a result, the problems of high pollution, energy, and multi-occupancy have not been fundamentally addressed in terms of the transformation of productive lifestyles.
On the one hand, from the various types of ecological environment creation in Jiangsu Province, the absolute superiority of the country is the first; but on the other hand, the resource environment is under pressure.
In order to promote ecological environmental protection and governance, it is necessary to promote the transformation of production and life in a fundamental way, so as to promote the transformation of ecological civilization.
11, at the Port of Lianyungang Port, a 42-piece wind turbine produced by the National Electric Group was prepared for export to South Africa.

The OCOG commissioned the flag-making third-party company (non-Chinese company) in Sao Paulo, Brazil, about 75 km from the city of Sao Paulo.
In order to urge the manufacturers to complete the work as soon as possible, the Chinese Consulate General in São Paulo organized a special person to go to the factory to do the work in depth.
After 30 hours of overtime, the manufacturer finally completed the production of the Chinese flag and loaded the vehicle, which would have required 4-5 working days ahead of schedule.
It is reported that the national flag is expected to arrive in Rio on the 11th, and after receiving the national flag, it will be delivered to various Olympic venues, and the entire process will be completed under the supervision of the Chinese embassy in Brazil.
More than 180 Shanghai enterprises were invited to participate in the Shanghai International Conference Centre (Shanghai International Conference Centre), and more than 180 Shanghai enterprises were invited to sign up for the Shanghai-Shanghai industrial docking project.
The 20 projects that have been centrally contracted have a total investment of 80.63 billion yuan, covering a variety of industries, including new energy sources, new materials and modern services.
Qingdao is the 12th in the country and the first city in Shandong province for the use of paid use and trade.
On the 11th day, a number of enterprises came to the Qingdao sewage power trading center to submit the application for emission rights, and will pay royalties after the purchase.
The deal, which is to be completed, also marks the beginning of the launch of the Qingdao emissions trading exercise, which will also be the first in the province for emissions trading and the first of the nation's city-level emissions trading.
On the morning of the 11 th morning, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao two-peach fine chemical (Group) Co. Ltd., came to the Qingdao sewage power trading center to submit the application for emission rights.
The factory, located in the old city of Qingdao, was shut down at the end of last year, and the environment was relocated to the new factory area.
Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, the environmental impact statement of the construction project and other materials, the Qingdao sewage power reserve and trading service center began the preliminary examination of the application materials.
In accordance with the collection criteria established by the price, financial and other sectors of Qingdao, the estimated initial royalty fees are estimated to be about $64.12 million, and staff members will complete their approval within 7 working days.
The soon-to-be-completed deal will also herald the launch of a pilot project on emissions trading in Qingdao, which will also be the first in the province for emissions trading and the first of the nation's city-level emissions trading.
Zhao Xiong said that at present, the enterprise environmental protection has invested up to 4 billion, the surface is huge, but it has a great influence on the concept of business management and social benefits, and opens up space for enterprise innovation management.
On the same day, the Qingdao Quartet New Integrity Bus Fittings Co., Ltd., also came to the annual production of 4200 high-speed rail and motor vehicle interior accessories projects to purchase emission rights.
The project belongs to the machining enterprise, the initial emission of the application is the chemical oxygen demand (COD) 0.514 tons / year, ammonia nitrogen (NOX) 0.052 tons / year.
The use and trading of atmospheric pollutant emission rights are the key industrial enterprises for electricity and thermal production in the whole city.
The existing sewerage units that have obtained the EIA before 1 January 2016 are temporarily exempt from the collection of royalties.
"Paid discharge is not the same as acquiring the power of illegal discharge, and does not discharge pollutants at will," he said.
Han Hongyan, deputy director of the Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau, said it was not possible to allow illegal enterprises to avoid punishment by purchasing emission rights if they were to be punished in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations.
In other words, in order to protect the environment and protect the public health by means of legal means to crack down on environmental violations, and severely punish enterprises for excess pollution.
Now, the enterprise, for its own benefit, raises the enthusiasm to cure the pollution, cherishes the limited emission rights and reduces the discharge of pollutants.
With the driving of economic interests, reducing the discharge of pollutants from the forced behavior of the government to the conscious market behavior of enterprises, so as to truly meet the goal of protecting the environment, protecting nature and safeguarding public health.
Emission rights, also known as "emission rights," are the right to discharge pollutants, referring to the rights of emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment in accordance with the law, within the limits allocated by the government.
In essence, this right is the right to occupy, use and benefit environmental capacity resources.
Next, on the premise that the total emission of pollutants does not exceed the allowable emissions, the internal sources of pollution transfer each other through currency exchange.
Since it was proposed by American economist Dale Stein in 1968, the United States began to apply it to the management of atmospheric and river sources in the 1970s.
Our country has been a pilot since 2007, and there are now 14 provinces (districts and municipalities) in Zhejiang and Jiangsu.
In an effort to help the six strategic bombers carry out air strikes against "Islamic State" targets in Syria, multiple Russian warplanes blasted off from Syria's Hermeymim air base to provide support, the Russian Defense Ministry said.
On 22 February this year, the United States reached an agreement with Russia on a cease-fire between the parties to the Syrian conflict, which has been in effect since 27 January.
According to the agreement, the cease-fire does not include military strikes against terrorist groups identified by the UN Security Council, such as the Islamic State's "Support Front."
Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure at the base, and the living conditions of the Russians will be guaranteed accordingly.
He also said those forces would expand into Russia without a crackdown on extremist forces.
While Russia and the West have not agreed on a joint fight against the extremist forces, Russia will strengthen its cooperation with Syria, Iran, Iraq and others in this regard.
In September 2015, Russia began military strikes against Syrian extremist forces at the invitation of the Syrian government.
On 15 March this year, the main Russian military forces began to withdraw, but the Russian side promised to remain at the Hermeim air base and the naval base in Tartus.
In the old house and the success of the case, he has done a very good demonstration: The inheritance of a century-old house, also tells the story of a piece of land.
Today, an average of 100,000 people flock to bamboo hills each year, either to bring a variety of ideas, or to seek inner peace.
In fact, the relationship between the country and the city should be with each other, like mother and child, not strong or weak, no one to rule who, should be very warm.
There is no fixed model for rural development, but it is difficult to make spontaneous changes in the countryside. The most important thing is to get the right people to the countryside.
The traffic management department of Songjiang District in Shanghai recently used electronic police to control drivers to drive their mobile phones and seized more than 30 cases a week.
With the popularity of smartphones, mobile phones are becoming more and more fun, swiping micro-letters, tweeting and even playing games, and visiting Taobao are the norm. Many people seem to be stuck with their phones and not even driving.
The Road Traffic Safety Act explicitly prohibits driving with a mobile phone and defines it as "an impediment to safe driving."
Unfortunately, this phenomenon has not been punished because of the number of offenders and the difficulty of obtaining them, and the provisions of the law have almost become the norm.
If the department is determined to "declare war" on mobile phone behavior, it will surely be curbed.
In order to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the archives, it is necessary to establish an electronic and paper-based archive for household registration materials without household registration.
The public security organ shall, in a timely manner, notify the relevant departments of the circumstances of the registration of persons without household registration.
Policy measures that are inconsistent with the spirit of this implementation will be subject to a centralized clean-up, with a serious revision of the amendment, which will be firmly repealed.
In the collective shed in Donglin Village, Taicheng, 48-year-old Wang Xuefen is taking the workers to spray pesticides on the pear trees.
The village's 150-acre orchard, with more than 10 tree species, requires only 12 workers plus one technical engineer.
Fifty thousand dollars last year, like my age, if working in a factory can't get the money.
Last year, Donglin Village earned $22 million, accounting for nearly half of total agricultural income.
Village Clerk Su Qi Fang: The area of land cultivation per capita is increasing every year, starting at 50 acres. It is now over 100 mu. The benefits are increasing every year, and the income of professional farmers increases every year.
With the quantification of shares to each villager, the biggest bright spot of the rural collective economic reform is to clarify the property rights of rural collective management assets and to explore the separation of government and government.
In July, 2015, 14 rural economic cooperation organizations and village councils in the city of Zion, Wuxi City, carried out the management of rural public affairs, and the cooperative organizations were mainly engaged in the operation.
The two institutions have two accounts and do not "connect" with each other to prevent corruption in the participation of village cadres in collective asset management.
In the next step, Jiangsu Province will continue to promote the reform of the community share cooperation system, encourage the joint development of farmers, and establish the operational mechanism of democratic power at the village level.
Good luck: Further reform of the reform forward, the community share cooperation, the quantification of assets to the members, fixed to the farmers, the formation of clear property rights.
Through the Internet +, the implementation of his right to know, the right to participate in decision-making and the supervision of democratic management, the implementation of the three rights to the farmers, does make it a standard operating mechanism.
At present, the new collective economy of Souan countryside mainly forms the asset leasing type, the enterprise share type, the agricultural development type, the joint development type 4 development model.
It is understood that the overseas exhibition has become an important platform to promote the construction of "all the way" in Zhejiang province.
The success of these overseas exhibitions has created a valuable experience and a good basis for the development of an integrated platform for overseas exhibition and exhibition.

Xiamen girl Zhang Binh: "Beautiful hand-style" started shooting the road career several times "reversed"
A few days ago, a 29-inch old TV was replaced by a 65-inch TV.
The average farmer's daughter was one of the men who won the silver medal in the women's 50-meter rifle final at the Rio Olympic Games on the night of the 11th night.
Day and night, just before the new TV show, Zhang Dong-hong and dozens of relatives and friends witnessed their daughter go all the way, from almost a pre-match to the magical process of near-reversal.
On the same day, Mr. Zhang, once ranked in the middle and lower, seemed to be a long way from the final.
But the parents and relatives did not give up, kept brushing the text and saw that, as the rest of the race was finished, Mr. Zhang stepped up and ended up in the final seat, with a burst of cheers from his home.
In the final, Zhang was in the position once again in the situation, the last few shots more steady, only behind the champion 0.2 ring to win the silver medal.
In his 16-year shooting career, the 27-year-old has nearly passed the hard-won silver medal in 16 years.
Zhang, his mother, told reporters that, as they hesitated, he found several "novelists" from the same village.
These "novelists" were the same village children who had been recommended for training at the same time, as well as a gentle cousin.
Soon after entering the Xiamen team, Mr. Zhang, once again because of family difficulties and other reasons, took the initiative to go back to the school.
But after his enlightenment coach Zhang Yajie repeated his work, he returned to the Xiamen team.
After entering the provincial team, Mr. Zhang, who had been slow to enter the national team, was once again at home because of a lack of hope.
This time, not only coach Zhang Yajie, Xiamen Shooting Athletic Center and Fujian Province team leaders and coaches all come to the home, finally to persuade Zhang to return to the provincial team.
As it was yesterday, the Xiamen girl's insistence on a reversal of the path of shooting.
"Every coach has a different way of picking players, and when I saw that he had a beautiful hand, I was in the middle of it all at once."
Zhang Dong-hong also recalled that in the training test, the daughter's performance was not the best, but the ring number is very stable, which is also an important reason to attract a coach.
In the course of training, Zhang Yajie impressed the most, is the farm girl's input.
He recalled that he had entered the Xiamen shooting team more than a year later, with a long-lasting gun training on the team, requiring the team to be unable to move for half an hour.
Zhang told reporters that the daughter had always been a quiet and clever child, who liked to draw and make handmade toys from a young age.
"It turned out that I would dress and mend at home, and I would pick up some corners to make my own dolls."
She says her daughter often makes handmade toys of her own, plus she is good at drawing, from the doll's five officers to the clothes, and can always be lifelike.
As an athlete, he and his family gathered much less, only the holidays to go home, usually by telephone.
The parents said, whether to meet or call, he rarely says his own hard work, more is to talk to parents about happy things.
It is not usual to see a daughter, the parents at home the painting of their daughter as a child and the honor of the calendar year are carefully collected.
Zhang showed her daughter's cartoon to reporters. "Without being a shooter, she should continue to paint."
In Zhang's second-floor living room, there was a cupboard full of medals, medals and certificates that she had obtained.
Zhang Dong-hong put the medals and medals in order, and the certificates were put together in the folder. "These are the honors of more than a decade's work, which we all cherish."
In recent days, the Tzu Chi Foundation of Hebei Province sent 16000 yuan to the village of Jingxing County, Tai Tau, Guiquan, and other villages.
This is another outpouring of sympathy from the fund to society in its search for the "7.19 flood of children, children and lonely old people."
7.19 Heavy rainfall has affected Hebei province, resulting in flooding in parts of the province and the death and disappearance of persons.
Good people "old iron" to help the community to drain the unfortunate sacrifice, leaving a 2-year-old child and a six-year-old wife, good people "old iron" sense of personnel moved the whole provincial city.
On August 4, the staff and Hebei brand volunteers in Hebei province came to the "old iron" home of the good people, handing over 3200 yuan of love to the family of the "old iron."
When the brand's vice-president, Ye Li, learned about the status of the "old iron" family, he decided to launch a "love-and-sell" campaign among the brand's corporate members to help the "old iron" family.
The Tzu Chi Foundation of Hebei Province, all known as the Hebei Province Voluntary Service Foundation, was launched in August 2015 by the Hebei Brand Society Preparatory Committee.
According to the Hong Kong Oriental Daily on 12 August, there are three major problems in the sale of diamonds in the Mainland, including the sale price of the dotted diamond, the weight of the dotted diamond, and the lack of aftermarket security.
While Antwerp is one of the largest diamond trading centres in the world, the diamond-cutting technology of local artisans is well known, and the diamonds sold are well-identified and popular with women from the Mainland.
"A small bag, held in the palm of the hand, a small handful, worth nearly a million dollars," Liu, who was involved in the purchase of diamonds, told the mainland media about her experience in Antwerp in June.
She pointed out that she hid the diamonds in her underwear, went to the toilet, took a bath for several days, and was very nervous to walk to bed.
She claims that the diamond bought in Antwerp has a purchase price of about fifty-five thousand dollars per carat, and the same quality diamond retails in Xiamen for about $110, 000.
She has sold all the diamonds and made a large sum of $200,000 at a time.
According to the Mainland Customs, diamond non-passengers in the itinerary of supplies or necessities, it belongs to the category of goods, the entry and exit should be declared, or as a smuggling, seriously can be sentenced to prison.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will travel to Switzerland for the summer holidays, but has not revealed a specific place to leave, according to foreign media reports.
In the wake of the British referendum, the new British prime minister chose to take a "neutral" Swiss holiday on the continent with some sort of policy symbolism, according to the media.
The symbolic representation of Switzerland as a neutral country played a role in the choice of the British Prime Minister's first resort, according to a Guardian review.
The Daily Telegraph notes that Theresa May has chosen to take a holiday to Switzerland, the first time a British prime minister has taken a holiday to Switzerland.
The choice of two female prime ministers contrasts with the likes of Blair and Cameron's two male prime ministers who enjoy a holiday in hotter places.
It is understood that Britain's new prime minister, Theresa May, will return to London on August 24, after a series of important jobs and events.
The British Parliament will resume on 5 September, and the debate will include an online request for a second Brexit referendum.
The British referendum on 23 June decided to leave, but Britain's new prime minister was reluctant to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on member states' Brexit by the end of the year.
Huangshan's existing non-material cultural heritage project 1325, the type and number of the province is the first.
Because of the non-genetic commitment of the emblem culture, it is imperative to use digital technology for preservation and protection.
The Standing Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) is planning to hear special work reports and carry out thematic inquiries on the implementation of banking supervision and management laws and services for local economic development.
In mid-August, the Standing Committee will organize two research teams to conduct research in selected cities to prepare for thematic queries.
Hua Jianhui pointed out that, for the first time in our province, the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress (NPCSC) listened to and considered the special work report of the vertical management department, and was the first of its kind in our province.
At the drill director's department in Kashgar, Xinjiang, with an order from the general director, the troops in Kashgar, Hisashi and Aksu moved quickly to carry out the maneuvers in accordance with the instructions.
China's Mars plan is coming
The mission of Mars exploration in our country is to achieve circumnavigation, landing and inspection, in a form that has never been seen abroad.
The goal of our Mars exploration launch is to move around, land and tour, a task of considerable difficulty.
Because Mars exploration takes 26 months to meet a time window, experts are closely working on an engineering plan to launch our first Mars rover in this window in 2020.
According to Xu, although our vehicle has entered deep space, it is still necessary to complete the Mars exploration mission, and the exploration of Mars means that China is entering the era of deep-space exploration in a real sense.
"Every two or three years, Mars is the most recent opportunity to launch a Mars rover at this point in time, which is the most energy-saving for a launch vehicle."
"Given the quality of the Mars rover, it will be up to our Long March 5 launch vehicle to complete the launch mission," he said.
China's Mars exploration mission to achieve a round, landing, tour, this form has never been abroad, foreign countries to achieve a round and landing, but the landing failed.
There are so many areas of technology involved in Mars exploration, and in particular, while the spark vehicle is a space probe, it has distinct features compared to a general space probe.
In other words, the Mars rover must have the ability to determine the route of travel and to detect the risk of obstacles.
The reason why humans are so interested in Mars exploration is that the exploration of Mars has important scientific, technological and other implications, even in relation to the future of mankind.
Mars has now become the planet with the highest degree of human research beyond Earth, and the history of Mars exploration by humans using space probes runs through almost the entire history of human space.
So humans hope to one day build a residential base on Mars and eventually migrate to Mars, turning it into a second home for humans.
There are plenty of signs that Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth, only after billions of years of evolution into a thin atmosphere, low temperatures, water depletion, and so on.
So a probe or a manned landing on Mars could put a plan in place to prevent the Earth from becoming the second Mars that makes it difficult for humans to survive.
As of June 2016, there were 114 lunar probes and 43 Mars detections worldwide.
However, from the 1990s to the present, humans have conducted a total of 18 missions to Mars, while lunar exploration has been conducted only 14 times.
There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars roaming vehicles at work, but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are working.
The world's space powers have developed detection programs targeting the Mars system, which shows that today's Mars exploration is hotter than lunar exploration.
On November 5, 2013, India launched its first Mars probe, "Mangarian," to become the first country in Asia to successfully detect Mars.
"Mangarian" is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars and explore whether there is methane and signs of life on Mars.
The hardest part of this mission is that there is only one chance for the probe to enter the Martian atmosphere with its aerodynamic shape and parachute slowing down
The Mars exploration mission faces a number of technical challenges, according to Sun Zezhou, chief designer of the Mars rover at the China Space Science and Technology Group.
Mars has a very low atmospheric pressure, only 1% of the atmospheric pressure on the Earth's surface, with a high degree of uncertainty.
Scientists do not yet have a thorough understanding of factors such as its changes and the nature of the storm.
Mars, which often forms a dust storm similar to the dust of the Earth during the summer, causes a sharp drop in the solar energy it receives, and has to design a "dormant" mode for the spark vehicle, allowing it to wait patiently for the dust storm to pass.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a cutting effect on solar light, which poses a challenge to the energy supply of Mars exploration.
This requires the probe's solar wings to be larger and subject to constant adjustment in an effort to focus on the direction of the sun.
Also, Mars' surface gravity is only 38 percent of Earth's, but much larger than the gravity of the moon's surface, so the probe needs more power.
"The most central and hardest part of this Mars exploration mission is the process by which the probe enters the Martian atmosphere with its aerodynamic shape and parachute slowing down, with only one chance to ensure success," he said.
Because the Earth is so far away from Mars, the whole process cannot be controlled by ground-to-ground control, so it has to rely on the probe to do it autonomously, Sun said.
With less propellant to offset that high speed, the slowdown depends on the Martian atmosphere when landing on Mars, but the Martian atmosphere is difficult to simulate on the ground.
In general, the way to detect Mars is similar to the way it detects the moon. It is also "around, down, tour, back" to achieve the goal of a manned landing on Mars.
Because Mars is much farther from Earth than the moon, the exploration of Mars requires a series of more complex technical difficulties.
According to Taiwan media reports, the "President of the Administration" announced yesterday morning that "the improper acquisition of property treatment regulations by political parties and their accompanying organizations" has been in effect since today.
"A more than 100-year-old Kuomintang, with the commitment and responsibility of the society, will not go out of business."
Lin stressed that if a party, accompanied by an organization or a trustee, violates the prohibition imposed by the regulations, the Commission will investigate and punish and punish "according to law" ex officio.
Lin also announced that the vice-chairman of the improper party committee will be held by the Deputy Director of the Integrity Department, Mr Hong Bacon.
He said it would be a good idea for Mr. Gu to be the chairman of the improper party committee, and to use the experience of Hong Bacon to check the relevant major cases in the past will serve as the basis for the Commission's inventory of cases of improper party production.
"Today, as long as there is party production, no one will give you social donations, and if all the party products are confiscated, the Kuomintang can just ask for social support and sponsorship," he said. "There's really no chance to go today."
He also stressed that, even if the improper party regulations hit the road, the KMT has not been fully confiscated or confiscated, and that the rest will remain committed to the pledge, leaving the party to zero, and that the party should start from scratch.
Original caption: "Corridor Doctor" Lancaster v CCTV presenter Wang Zhiyan's reputation infringement in first instance
As a result of CCTV presenter Wang Zhian's remarks on Sina Weibo on Sina Weibo, he brought Wang Chi'an and Beijing Microdream Network Technology Co. Ltd. to the court.
Yesterday afternoon, Haidian court issued a judgment on the case, which found that Wang Chi'an and the Microdream Company did not constitute an infringement and rejected all the claims.
In early 2014, a CCTV reporter, Wang Zhiyan, found that despite more than 600 days of sitting in a hospital corridor being shaped by the media as a tragic hero of institutional repression, there was a great deal of false information.
On March 29, 2014, a CCTV news investigation into the production of "The Corridor Doctor" aired.
There is no evidence to support the various so-called over-medical information reported to the media.
Wang Zhiyan also in the real-name certification of the microblog, described "the reason that the Rangfeng came to this step is due to the character, with its obvious paranoid personality."
He asked Wang to delete the tweet, apologize and pay him $100,000 for moral damage.
At the court hearing, the two sides argued over whether Wang had violated the reputation of Lan Yue Feng.
12-day watch: The Chinese team is very busy and the women's soccer team is looking forward to the breakthrough
Cycling is on track to achieve a "zero break" in Olympic gold, while the women's soccer team will challenge two-time world champion Germany, expecting to burst into the top four.
Wang Zhen has been outstanding for nearly two seasons and won silver at the world championships in Beijing last year, and in May this year the group went to the World Championships to upgrade the individual project title.
Zhang Huizhen, a 27-year-old South Korean archer, won a gold medal in the women's archery individual event and won an Olympic gold medal after a team event to become a double champion, according to foreign media.
Zhang, who is believed to be a late winner of the last London Olympics, is proud to stand on the top podium of the Rio Olympics.
Richard Chang won the gold medal in the final of the women's archery singles final at the Rio Samba Avenue Stadium in Brazil, beating Germany's Liza Onu 6-2, 6-2.
She did her first archery in the fourth grade, until the 27-year-old won her first individual gold medal at the World Cup in 2014 and was a late winner.
"There wasn't a level before high school to be able to compete nationally," Mr. Zhang recalled.
Zhang, who won only a fourth place in the London Olympics four years ago, was sorry to lose the Olympic ticket, allowing her colleague and close friend Chip to win two gold medals.
At the end of the medal ceremony of the women's archery event, Zhang said, "Until the end of the day it is possible to shoot as much as possible, and it may be that this brings good results and satisfaction.
The 28-year-old South Korean archery "one-sister" and London Olympic archery individual gold medalist Chipotle won the bronze medal.
Chipotle lost to Zhang Huizhen in the semifinals, competing in the bronze medal battle with Mexico's Alejandro Valencia.
Chipotle to ensure the bronze medal after the tears of the field, during which the silently bear the burden of the money can be imagined.
The first is that the coaching staff has accumulated a lot of experience in constant research, followed by scientific training methods, which need to be accumulated over a long period of time.
Archery team with military training, night crossing the cemetery and other methods to help the team to concentrate and maintain a common heart.
Although it has not been confirmed, many sources say that Apple's autumn 2016 launch will be held in September.
While Apple did not respond, there has been news about the new iPhone's features, configuration, and even the iPhone 7 "real-machine model."
The next generation of iPhones are "eye-catching," hot, tight and rich... If you want to buy in the first place, be sure to choose a good channel, say, Su Ning.
This adds to the frustration with the new phone, "It's lengthened, but it can't project a hologram at all! This generation of iPhones sucks."
The iPhone 7, like other iPhones, was born with countless secrets.
Also, multiple sources claim that a new generation of iPhones will eliminate the 3.5mm headphone interface and switch to a Bluetooth connection and charging interface, which will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker.
Another evidence to support the news is that, as early as 2014, Apple allowed headphone manufacturers to produce headphone products connected through a charging interface.
The news or true or false, the answer won't be known until Apple's autumn 2016 launch.
But that doesn't prevent the industry from being bullish about the future of the iPhone 7 - many believe the iPhone 7 will likely be the last major upgrade of Apple's iPhone series.
Despite data from the recent market research agency IDC, the iPhone's market share has declined.
Among them, Goldman maintains a "buy" rating on Apple's stock, while BMO analysts say the iPhone 7 will reap a historic sales result.
At the same time, the company's CEO, Hock Tan, said Apple's future revenue will likely increase by more than 20%, thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7.
Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to buy the iPhone 7, compared with 4 percent two years ago.
It is understood that 20 per cent of the user groups currently holding the iPhone 6 or 6Plus are planning to buy the iPhone 7, which is a fairly high proportion.
Second, with expert analysis, most fruit powders prefer to replace their own iPhones from one generation to the next.
According to statistics, about 26 percent of all iPhone users have not replaced their phones in two years, or nearly 120 million users have used their iPhones for two years.
There have been media reports that Taiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the iPhone 7 production period. "The extent of the damage is beyond imagination and has the potential to have an impact on the initial iPhone 7 supply."
The contradiction between supply and demand will affect the average user, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time low price to start the new iPhone 7.
In the near term, Suning has met frequently with Apple in order to prepare for an adequate supply of goods, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Operators have settled with Suning, and predictably, with deep cooperation from both sides, it will inevitably lead to lower prices and more intimate services for users.
"At the lowest price, consumers may be able to buy the iPhone 7 for just seven yuan a day."
With ample supply and a variety of preferences, the purchase of the iPhone 7 is no longer "pressure mountain", and Su Ning's logistics will turn this good into a more intuitive sense of experience.
Perhaps, you'll get a phone call in the middle of the night, "Hello, Suning is easy to buy, your iPhone 7 is here."
The organizers hope that through the cultural heritage exhibition, the local people will learn more about the long-standing Chinese culture and thus enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.
Barcelona's "Ming Dynasty Heritage Show" is part of a European tour that will run until early October.
The bank released its 2016 semi-annual report yesterday, and in the second quarter it renewed its stake in the company.
By the end of June, it had increased its shares to 3.87 million shares, from 3.35 per cent to 3.62 per cent.
In the second quarter, it added 38 million shares, and held its shares to nearly 600 million shares, accounting for 2.77 percent of the bank's shares.
In recent days, the village of Tongxiang, Zhejiang Province, is officially open to villagers and tourists.
The garden is made up of more than 100 round small ponds, planting about 300 varieties of ornamental lotus flowers, water lilies, etc.
With the ornamental, leisure and economic benefits, the rural lotus flower industry has become the highlight of the new rural development.
The Rio Olympics "green pool" has been the subject of much attention in recent days, according to foreign media reports.
However, the water from the water polo match pool, adjacent to the diving pool, turned green on the morning of the 10th.
The Australian water polo player said after the game that he felt a sting in his eyes and wanted to shed tears.
Earlier, Rio Olympic officials confirmed the water had turned green and said the water discoloration was due to an alkaline weakening that would not affect athletes' physical health.
But the Australian athlete said after winning the match with the Japanese team in the water polo pool, his eyes stung.
At the earliest, after the pool water turned green, the organizers worked overtime to deal with the pool problem on the evening of 9 p.m., but on the morning of the 10th, the color of the water polo pool changed rapidly.
The environmental conditions of the water polo pool have progressively deteriorated during the Australian team's match against Japan, but officials have stressed they will restore the water quality of the two pools to their original colours on the 11th day.
"Yesterday afternoon, water was less alkaline in the pool," said Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the Rio Olympics.
"We are aware of a range of causes that may cause water discoloration in the pool, as well as the alkalinity of the water quality," he said.
The water sports center conducted a series of tests on water quality, and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the pool to determine the quality of the water.
"We have been going through normal procedures these days, but we may have ignored the fact that the more athletes are likely to have an impact on water quality," he said.
"But changes in water colour certainly have no effect on physical health, especially for athletes."
"This independent team confirmed our assessment and the measures we have taken to restore the pool to normal colour and normal chemistry," the statement said.
"We had hoped that the pool would return to normal in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected by the rain.
Taiwan's "Central Society" reported an explosion yesterday night in one of the prisons on the outskirts of Metro Manila, injuring the governor and killing 10 prisoners, reportedly including two Chinese.
ABS-CBN-TV reported that the incident took place at Paranaque prison at around 9pm last night, but police did not make a preliminary statement until 2am today.
The police said the 10 prisoners sought to see the warden and complained about the transfer, but there was no speculation on both sides, with prisoners throwing grenades and causing explosions.
Prison authorities have not yet released the names of the dead prisoners, but GMA TV reported that it included two Chinese.
As of 8 a.m., the prison authorities had yet to provide a detailed explanation, including how the prisoners obtained the grenades.
Yesterday, Central Philippine police entered the Leyte district prison, killing one of the victims of an "attempted attack on the police."
It is necessary to sign a contract with the tourist.
Xinjiang has entered the peak tourist season in order to regulate the business order of the tourist market, and the law enforcement detachment of the tourism law enforcement branch of the city of Urumqi did not regulate the tourist vehicles in the market yesterday.
At eight o'clock yesterday morning, about 10 large buses full of tourists were parked around the Kempinski Hotel, most of them on a day trip to Tianchi.
"Hello, I'm from the tourist board of the city of Urumqi. Have you signed a contract with this travel agency?"
Yu Bin, a staff member of the Law Enforcement Detachment of the city of Urumqi, said: "There is also a tour bus in the city of Urumqi, and there is no qualification."
"There is a fine of up to three hundred thousand dollars for this penalty, and the driver's failure to practise is a fine of 2000 yuan."
It is understood that the tourism law enforcement authorities in the city of Urumqi have checked the concentration of tourist attractions such as Western Park and Red Hill.
"The first is safety, the second is the norm, the tourist vehicle is no small matter, once the problem is a group injury," said Ma Qi, deputy leader of the tourism law enforcement team in Urumqi.
"We are jointly and continuously inspecting the market and regulating the safety of travel agents to ensure the safety of visitors," he said.
On the morning of 12 August, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the functioning of the national economy in July 2016.
In July, the growth rate of some indicators of the national economy slowed, but it was still in a reasonable range, according to a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics and the Director of the National Economic Statistics Division.
Data released by the Office for National Statistics showed that data on fixed-asset investment growth and total imports fell in July.
With regard to the operation of the national economy in July, I would like to borrow a phrase that the Prime Minister has said is "volatile and still good," which gives a good overview of the characteristics of July's economic performance.
He explained that "volatility" refers to the fact that some of the economic indicators slowed in July.
Because the domestic and foreign economy is still in deep adjustment in July, the international situation is complex and changeable, the recovery of the world economy is less than expected, so the export pressure is still relatively large.
In the domestic context, the economy is still in a critical phase of adjustment, the pain of adjustment is being released and the economy is under considerable downward pressure, so some of the indicators are somewhat volatile.
It noted that there was a special situation in July, with severe flooding and high temperatures, which had some impact on production operations in some areas.
According to a recent release by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people in the country have been affected, with direct economic losses of more than 200 billion yuan.
These areas are affected to varying degrees in terms of industrial, investment and transport-related indicators.
In July, the volume of shipments slowed by 3.6 percentage points from the previous month, with flooding affecting traffic in those areas.
In view of these factors, the volatility of some of the indicators in July was also normal and expected.
"The situation is still good," he said, referring to the fact that, despite the slowdown in economic growth, the economy is generally stable, steady and stable.
In July, the CPI rose 1.8 per cent and the ring was up 0.2 per cent; in January-July the CPI rose 2.1 per cent, so the price situation was generally stable.
According to the Chongqing Bureau of Meteorology's statistics on the high-temperature weather in each district, except Youyang, the rest of the city can receive a different degree of high-temperature allowance.
Currently, at least 28 provinces across the country have clear criteria for the issuance of allowances, although the standards are not the same in the provinces, while Chongqing receives a high-temperature allowance in the form of a high-temperature working day allowance.
Those under 37 ° C above 35 ° C shall be issued at a rate of not less than $10 per person per day; those above 37 ° C shall be issued at a rate of not less than $15 per person per day.
High-temperature staff above 40 ° C are entitled to a maximum allowance of $20 / day per month (with the exception of workers who are already entitled to the high-temperature job allowance in accordance with the law).
By this standard, the state with the largest number of high-temperature days last month received 330 yuan, while the lowest number of days was 80 yuan, while the highest temperature in Youyang did not meet the high temperature standard, so there was no high temperature allowance.
In the past, many units will be able to offset the high-temperature allowance with a cool drink, which the city's security bureau says is not in line with the current practice.
The employing units shall not deduct or reduce the wages of labourers due to the suspension of working hours and the reduction of working hours.
Employees who encounter high temperatures while operating at high temperatures may seek legal interest through the labour dispute mediation agency in which they are located, or call 12333 complaints, according to the City Council.
If an employer refuses to grant a high-temperature allowance, the worker may lodge a complaint with the competent human resources social security department at or above the county level.
At the same time, because the high-temperature allowance is part of the salary, it is not a benefit, it is to be included in the total wage and a tax deduction.
Therefore, the high temperature allowance, which is not covered by the minimum wage, must be paid in cash and cannot be replaced in kind, such as beverages.

Gracia is a budding female giant bird, with the smell of a tropical rain forest.
In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the giant bird Gracia and its story have long been a household name.
At a news conference on 10 August, Grazia, who is recovering after surgery, finally made an appearance to show people its brand new 3D printed plastic bird beak.
It was only a year and a half ago that the beaked, dying giant bird was finally reborn.
The day not only declared that it was 100% healthy, but also the day when it moved into a luxury birdhouse and met with its human friends who cared about it.
Gracia, who was first in his new home, was slightly shy, but soon became lively, rolling in the tub and eating grapes with a new beak.
To remind people of the damage it once suffered, technicians didn't color its new beaks, instead retaining the original white of the 3D-printed material.
The beak of the bird is a thin layer of horny sheaths, hollow inside, with only a few thin bone support poles.
Despite this internal reinforcement, the beak is fragile and will break when it is hurt.
Animal rescue centres, ornithologists and a 3D printing company in the US have teamed up to create several "test beaks" for Gracia, creating the "perfect beak" that best suits it.
Now Grazia has been able to use a new beak to drink water, eat, and even pick up tiny grains of grain.
"It took about two months to design the final finished product and it would take just four or five hours to print out," he said.
"3D printing is not the technology of the future, it has literally come into your life," Thomas Langer, chairman of the SG3D printing company, told news.com.au.
In January 2015, Grazia, who was covered in blood, was found on a farm in Gracia, central Arahuela province, Costa Rica.
At that time its upper beak was brutally broken by a gang of young men, and it was completely unable to eat and life was in danger.
The tragic case of Gracia, after media reports, caused a wave of anti-animal abuse in and around Costa Rica.
There have been calls for stricter animal protection laws and greater penalties for abusers.
People spontaneously come forward and do their best to help Gracia recover as much as possible from her pre-injury life.
Even 3D printing technology inventor Chuck Hull was involved in the design of Grecia's beaks.
"Gracia is very special, with less than 1 cm remaining in its upper beak, so it brings a lot of difficulty to installing a new beak."
"We scanned Grazia first and then designed and produced an extended prosthesis that was slightly longer than the remainder of its upper beak, and fixed it on its upper beak."
"This could reduce the risk of further invasive injuries to Gracia," Longer told news.com.au.
Before installing the prosthesis, staff had to clear the beaks for Gracia every day in case of infection.
Far from thousands of miles away, the story of the giant bird Gracia touched the attention of acclaimed documentary director Paula Eredia and Discovery News Channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded the details of Grazia's installation of the new beaks, recording a documentary, "The State of the Mockingbird," which was broadcast on the Animal Planet channel this month.
The documentary "The State of the Mockingbird" shows how a tiny giant bird can make a country change, and how to engage the nation in the fight against animal abuse.
Core tip: Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of China's small independent oil refinery known as the "teapot."
JX Energy, Japan's biggest oil company, believes "the expansion of China's exports is one of the reasons why the market is depressed," Japan's biggest oil company, JX Energy, said on August 12.
Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of China's small independent oil refinery known as the "teapot."
The quality of China's oil products is getting closer to Japanese oil as a result of the Chinese government's tightening of environmental regulations.
Prior to obtaining the crude oil import license, the "teapot refinery" generally imported heavy oil with high sulphur content from places such as Russia.
The production of petroleum products with high sulphur content, poor oil, has become one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining permission to import crude oil, the "teapot refinery" was able to import low-sulphur Omani crude oil and Russian crude oil, and the quality of its petroleum products also rose.
"With the increasing quality standards of petroleum products in China, the capability of refining equipment has also improved," the company said.
As a result, the quality of petroleum products exported from China has gradually reached the same level as that of Japan, the highest quality in the world.
JX Energy said that "after the end of 2015, China began exporting high-quality light oil to Australia" to compete with Japanese products in the Asian market.
Although "Japan's high-quality oil" is facing a crisis, Japan's oil companies have adopted a strategy of "exporting to profitable areas while paying attention to the market."
As China's export of petroleum products has a huge impact on the Asian market, the attention to the teapot refinery is increasing.
Since its launch on May 26, after two months of enrollment, more than 800 people have applied for grants.

According to the Bureau of Statistics, the increase in the population of New Zealand was more than 2 per cent at the peak of the "baby boom" population in the early 1970s and early 1960s.
As of June of this year, New Zealand's net inflow of migrants in 12 months was 6.91 million, making it the main driver of New Zealand's population growth in recent years.
In addition, the natural population growth in New Zealand was 2.82 million during the same time period.
Data show that in the past 10 years, New Zealand's average annual net inflow of immigrants was 2.18 million, with an average annual natural population increase of 3.23 million.
Demographically, the influx of migrants means a gradual increase in the proportion of the "working-age population" between the ages of 15 and 39.
In the 12 months to June 2006, New Zealand's working-age population grew by 3.6 per cent to 1.58 million.
At the same time, the increase in the number of older persons over the age of 65 was also 3.6 per cent, to 70 million.
At 10: 00 am yesterday, the X9003 international cargo squad departed from the new station in Xi'an to Almaty, Kazakhstan.

Ultraviolet light not only darkens the skin of the students, more will sunburn the skin, how to allow the skin to go through the military training smoothly, do not get sunburn?
Sunscreen packaging is generally marked with SPF and PA, and SPF refers to SPF, which is for UVB UV, our common SPF index of 15, 30, 50, etc.
A product marked with PA is directed at UVA so that the sunscreen will play a more effective role. Usually, the strength of the PA is expressed in + to indicate an extension of the effective protection time.
Oily skin should choose a strong water-based sun protection, sun protection spray is also a good choice.
Dry skin should choose frost-like sunscreen; neutral skin is generally not strict, sensitive skin on any maintenance is a burden, it is recommended to choose pure physical sun protection products.
Remember to apply sunscreen half an hour in advance, as sunscreen will take time to fully seep into the skin.
Military training for a long time, sunscreen every two hours to have a lasting effect, do not be lazy.
Because the skin has just been stimulated by the sun, the military training comes back not to use whitening products immediately.
After military training, if you have the condition, you can use a towel wrapped in ice to ice the burned skin to slow the local heat.
Farmers who purchase agricultural machinery during the exhibition continue to apply the policy of cumulative subsidies, and farmers can obtain up to 40 per cent of the subsidies for the purchase of agricultural machinery.
This exhibition is open to the world, especially to the "along the road" countries and target market countries.

"Xiang Fair" has become an important platform for the local development of characteristic industries and the promotion of characteristic industries out of the country.
On some nights, the ionosphere is full of free electrons, which means that radio signals can go much further.
The U.S. Air Force is interested in replicating this effect, according to the August 11 issue of the American Journal of Popular Science.
It may not be of interest to the US Air Force, although a steady stream of free electrons can help people listen to the radio on the edge of a university radio station.
The electron-filled ionosphere means that the radio used by the military has a greater range of transmission, and it may provide some protection for GPS signals to protect them from solar storms.
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of Cubs based on demand, which can strengthen the ionosphere when needed.
But first, the team that contracts with the Air Force must prove that the scientific principles will work.
Industry data showed that total coal capacity in 2015 was close to 6 billion tons, with an excess of 1.8 billion tons of coal capacity across the country.
In the past decade, the State Department has issued five notices to eliminate excess and backward production capacity.
Although the first four did not target the coal industry, the target industry was directly linked to the coal industry.
From November to January of this year, Qinhuangdao's 5500 big-card-powered coal prices have long hovered at 370 yuan / ton, and 90 percent of coal companies have fallen into losses.
Since February, coal prices have picked up, and recently the price of power coal in Qinhuangdao has risen for four weeks, rising to a 16-month high of 436 yuan a tonne, up nearly 70 yuan from the start of the year.
As prices recover, there are fears that a small group of coal mines will not return to work?
In this regard, the Director of the Economic Institute of the Reform and Development Institute of China (Hainan) carried out the analysis and interpretation.
It has attracted a lot of attention from all parties, and today's report on the capacity of the coal industry is a real source of concern.
These three surface factors are still a reflection of the relative lag in our approach to growth in the past, which is that the government-led approach to growth has not been fundamentally changed.
Second, it is also directly related to the advancement of local governments, where funding and accompanying measures are in place, and from this perspective, the differences in different regions are indeed greater.
Third, if some provinces with a slower pace of progress are to make progress in the second half of the year, they may be at greater risk.
In this case, the process of relying on the central prize money to advance the process of going to capacity may have a negative impact.
First of all, to go to the capacity is not simply to carry out total control.
Our aim is to reconstruct the new industry of the whole coal industry by eliminating backward production capacity and advancing the optimization of the structure.
In the process of deploying to production capacity, the local government must combine the transformation and upgrading of production capacity and coal industry to develop the related service industries.
Second, we should make full use of the power of administrative supervision and administrative supervision if we are to complete this year's capacity for this year.
Finally, we need to strengthen the role of social security.
Because the market is directly related to employment, we need to strengthen job skills training for employees and workers.
"The decline in the rankings is due to a deterioration in the expectations of foreign investment in the development of Brazil's GDP in the medium term," he said.
Brazil's participation in global direct investment was 3.7 per cent in 2015, down from 5.7 per cent in 2014.
Credit Suisse's international investment attraction index includes four sub-indices: Infrastructure, economic outlook, business environment and direct investment volume.
Brazil's international direct investment in 2015 was $6.46 billion, down from $73.1 billion in 2014.
Last year, "greenfield investment" in Brazil (an investment model to invest in factories abroad) was $17.9 billion, a decrease of 2.1 per cent year-on-year.
"There are 288 'greenfield investment' projects in Brazil, compared with an annual average of 314 between 2003 and 2014."
However, international direct investment in Brazil reached $33.8 billion in the first half of 2016, an increase of almost 10 per cent on the same period last year.
Originally published as Canadian police kill IS supporters: Home-made bomb attack is near the end of preparatory work
The taxi company said the taxi was dispatched to the Devon home before police arrived.
Canadian police said in a news conference Wednesday that information received by police included a "martyrdom video" provided by the FBI about the young man who was about to carry out the attack.
A man wearing a black Ballarat hat was reading the Koran, referring to crimes against Muslims, and vowed to launch an attack on a Canadian city soon, Deutsche Welle reported.
He said in the video that the attack would take place within 72 hours and was at rush hour.
The incident came as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came to power last year, the first time police killed a terror suspect before the incident.
The upgrade of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal feeder channel old Wanfu River, Peking University slip channel to collect tolls from September 1.
The two branches of the tributary channel take the social financing mode of reform and construction, the fees have been approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government.
The old Wanfu River channel flows through Jinxiang, fish platform, via Nanyang Lake into the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, with a total length of 32.5 km.
According to the need of navigation, the old Wanfu river channel adopts the way of conservation and transformation, the local water depth is deep, the local sharp bend is bent, and the navigation conditions can be improved.
The channel flows through Jinxiang County, Ren City, via Nanyang Lake into the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, a total length of 19 kilometers.
The construction of the two lanes was started in February 2011, and in January 2015 it was completed, and the main body of investment construction and operation was the Anping Canal Logistics Service Centre in Jining City.
According to the principle of "loan construction, charging loan repayment," the Anping Canal Logistics Service Centre in Jining City collects the tolls of shipping lanes on the basis of fees approved by the Shandong Provincial Price Bureau.
Of these, the base toll is calculated at $1.75 / load, and the mileage toll is calculated at $0.05 / km.
The tolls will take place from 15 June 2016 to 14 June 2019.
The journalists from the Jining City Port Authority have learned that there are currently four toll lanes in Jining, respectively, in the waters of the SoHo River, the White Horse River Channel, the Peking University slipway, and the old Wanfu River.
The four lanes, the tributary channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, have been upgraded by means of social financing.
It is the first to adopt the "government + market" model for the construction of the infrastructure of the inland river port of Shandong Province.
The white horse river, the old Wanfu River, Peking University and other feeder channels take the way of pure market operation.
The funds allocated by the state finance can not meet the needs of the construction, and restrict the progress of the upgrade of the channel.
The use of social funds for the construction of public infrastructure is in line with the requirements of national policy, as well as a way to crack the bottleneck.
Ning Zeitao's performance in the 100-meter freestyle semifinals has left many Chinese viewers speechless.
But in the 50-meter freestyle heats, Ning Zeitao once again refreshed people's "bottom line."
The 50-meter freestyle was not the main item, and his performance and best performance at the World Championships in Kazan also made it less likely that he would make a breakthrough in the project.
Sure enough, Hong Kong's authoritative media outlet, The Grand Bulletin, revealed that the biggest reason for the defeat was that he had lost interest in swimming.
Many of the over-the-counter factors may have had a big impact on his idea of the future, and he may now be more interested in moving into showbiz.
After the world championships in Kazan, Ning Zeitao, with its ultra-high face value and good grades, instantly became the net red.
As a result, "national husband," "small fresh meat," "pattern beautiful man" and other names are constantly becoming the label on him.
All kinds of commercial activities come to the door, the good money way, become a golden light of the road.
In this case, it is not only his freedom, not only his freedom, but a seemingly viable path, even if he chooses to retire and join the entertainment industry at this time.
After all, he is only 23 years old, and after a certain amount of study, he can play one or two television dramas with his popularity.
But Mr Ningsih needs to see if he is qualified enough to be compared with these predecessors.
At the Sydney Olympics in 2000, 21-year-old Liu Xuan has come to the end of the athlete's career.
She was quickly remembered and laid the foundation for her future foray into the entertainment industry.
After retiring, Liu has appeared in a number of TV dramas and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tian Liang participated in two Olympic singles and 10-meter games, and won two gold and two silver.
But after losing to team-mate Hu Jia in the 2004 Olympic singles, Tian Liang's form slipped and was fired from the diving team.
He and his daughter took part in a variety show such as "Where's Daddy Go," which made him pay attention.
Once the gymnastics gold generation Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and Chen an ice all high-profile participation in various variety shows.
It is worth mentioning that Yang Wei Li, who led China to the 2008 Olympic men's championship, Yang Wei has twice won the individual all-round gold medal, known as the All-Energy King.
Chen, while leading China to the 2012 Olympic team championship, also became the king of the ring.
In the event of a miscarriage of justice at the London Olympics, Chen an ice-generous move, also let him circle the powder countless.
But the main energy of these athletes is still on the court, and for the variety show is just like a bit of water - just go.
But whether retired or active athletes, to be able to get the entertainment industry's favor will need to have the performance to guarantee the performance.
After all, athletes step into a new field, whether the ability or the human veins, is a blank state.
Even Tian Liang, Liu Xuan, the "old people" of the entertainment circle for many years, the general audience mentioned them, more still thought of their performance in the Olympic Games.
And Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and other new people, in the variety show when the introduction, invariably is "Olympic champion."
Compared to more than a few people, Ning Zeitao a swimming world champion's famous head is still slightly thin.
What's more, in contrast to the success of Tian Liang, Liu Xuan, Yang Wei and others, Ning Zeitao, at the age of 23, has suffered a slight setback in his career, and the negative impact on his image is probably immeasurable.
After all, to mention athletes, people's demands are "don't ask for a hundred wins, but do not be afraid of the danger", Ning Zeitao is far from this point.
A thousand steps back to say, Ning Zeitao is very handsome, can rely on Yan value to get the support of thousands of brain powder.
No hard work, only the appearance, want to be in the entertainment circle, this is not more difficult than training to find the right state.
The road of life is chosen by the will of the individual, but how to choose, Ning Zeitao should know.
On the surface, the online social platform expands the ballroom and reduces people's sense of loneliness.

New people in the company love to communicate with their colleagues, "because the people in the unit are not very familiar, through the social platform to comment, the relationship is much closer than before."
"There was a time when I had no contact with a friend because of some misunderstanding, and then a few conversations in a large group."
Wu, an IT engineer, is a deep online social enthusiast, and most of his social life is on the line, with network contacts more than double the number of friends on the line.
Wu said he was more "like a fish in the water" on the internet.
"You can reply to your friends at your own convenience, because there is a lot of time to say, and the presentation will be clearer."
"Hidden under the ID you come to me to avoid face-to-face interpersonal collisions, not only with wiggle room, but even more time and space for each other to think and say."
"People of different identities have the same right and efficiency to speak, and social concerns in real life seem to be eliminated in cyberspace."
However, Wu's friend Xiaopeng feels that the life of Wu is a "very boring house man."
Xiao Peng and Wu Yan met in a large group, as both were active speakers and quickly became acquainted with each other.
Xiao Peng thought that Wu spoke to the network of two people, the words boring, also do not express an opinion, turn over a few words "Oh, good, yes," or "this I want to check on the Internet."

The Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have come up with different forecasts for the country's economic development and inflation in 2016.
For both indicators, the Asian Development Bank forecasts 4.2 per cent and 7 per cent, World Bank forecasts of 4.8 per cent and 7.5 per cent, and IMF forecasts of 3.4 per cent and 8.2 per cent.
It is understood that despite the impact of a series of adverse external factors, such as the international economic downturn, the devaluation of the Russian ruble and the decline in remittances, the economy of Tasmania grew by 6 per cent in 2015.
"It was so urgent, and there was only one idea in my mind to save people!" She said.
Huang Eileen is a student at the Class of 2015 at the Mid-South Linlithgow School of Landscape Architecture.
Huang Eileen, who is a professional in urban and rural planning, wanted to visit Sichuan Langzhong to study the local architectural design, so the family went on a tour.
At around 10: 00 a.m. on August 8, Huang's father took a break at the hotel, and the mother and daughter came out to explore the ancient city of Langzhong.
After a short walk, I suddenly saw a group of people shouting, out of curiosity, and went forward.
"When the little boy had disappeared, the little girl was in the water, her little head covered with her little head, and she was sinking from time to time," said Huang Irin, who had learned to swim as a child, and jumped down in a hurry to save.
After the water, the height of 165 cm of yellow Eileen found that it was not the end!
Before the seemingly calm surface of the water, underneath is the rapids!
But she was desperate to swim to the little girl.
Mr. Huang said the river was muddy and fast, less than five metres away, and almost ran out of all her strength.
She tried her best to push the little girl to the bank of the river. "The slope was so slippery that I was afraid I would not have the strength to go down."
So she asked her mother for help, and when she heard her daughter's call for help, Ms. Yin, who had no water, was ready to go to the rescue and was stopped by the tourists next to her.
On August 10, she received a lot of sympathy and praise from many friends and friends. She was also "held accountable" by many friends and friends.
"In retrospect, I was really scared! To tell you the truth, my heart broke when the child insisted on not going down on the bank of the river."
Despite the danger, Ms. Yin said, she would still be supportive of her daughter's choice, and she was proud of her daughter!
As a result of being cornered, she rarely took the initiative after learning to swim. "I didn't expect this skill to be used."
According to Chen, the monitor of Huang's class, Huang Eileen is recognized as a "bully" in the class and is ready to help others.

On the morning of 11 a.m., Jining city bus company IC card sales center, a few elderly people in front of the card window, 62-year-old Yao got the old-age half-price card.
In the past, the Jining City Council, the Municipal Finance Bureau and the City Department of Transportation issued a notice on half-price urban buses for older persons aged 60-64, which was formally implemented on 1 September this year.

The SFC said today that the two securities regulators, as well as the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, are working closely together, according to the SFC's official microblog.
At the same time, the SFC has set up a special working group on Shenzhen-Hong Kong to actively promote the preparation of Shenzhen-Hong Kong, which will be opened this year after the relevant regulatory rules and technical equipment are in place.
The group sent fraudulent text messages to a certain number, even if the fraud is successful, can also be punished with fraud.
The trial by the People's Court of Wollongong District, Nanyang City, Henan Province, found that from 30 September to 4 October 2005, the defendant, Li Shengwang, used pseudo-base station equipment to send fraudulent information in the Tongber and Nanyang urban areas.
In the same year, on October 5, 10, the accused returned to a hotel room in Wollongong District, Nanyang City, where he was captured by the public security police when he used pseudo-base stations to send fraudulent text messages.
As a result of the assessment, the pseudo-base station device sent a text message on April 4, 2005, which resulted in an interruption of more than 8 seconds to less than 10 minutes in the communications of 6,2228 mobile phone users.
The court heard that the defendant, Li Yiwan, had used pseudo-base stations to send fraudulent text messages to an unspecified majority, which amounted to fraud.
It is recommended to adopt the opinion of light punishment in the case of an accused person who has been arrested in an attempt to commit an offence, has no consequences and is found guilty.
He was sentenced to four years and six months' imprisonment for fraud and a fine of $10,000.
The north-east tiger is currently listed as an endangered (EN) species by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List of Endangered Species.
According to the Ministry of Forestry of Jilin Province, data from the joint monitoring of countries such as China and Russia in 1998 showed that there were only four to six wild north-east tigers in Jilin province and 3 to 5 in the Northeast.
In recent years, Jilin Province has been increasing the protection of wild animals, and the population of the north-east tiger and the north-east leopard in China is growing significantly and the distribution region is expanding.
The most recent monitoring data for 2015 showed that in Jilin province alone, there were 27 tigers in the wild and 42 in the north-east.
The cooperation between China and Russia is of great significance for the population recovery and reproduction of tigers and leopards in the wild.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, Jilin Province has established a long-term cooperative exchange mechanism with Russia.
At the International Forum on the Conservation of Tiger Panthers in Hunchun, China, which ends on the 11th day of 2016, the Chinese and Russian forestry departments and animal protection organizations have once again reached a consensus.
The Ministry of Forestry of Jilin Province said the strengthening of China-Russia tiger and leopard protection cooperation is not only a very urgent task for China's north-east tiger and leopard protection, but also a top priority for the health of the Russian tiger and leopard population.
As a leading cadre of Party members, Sun Fujian has lost his ideal faith, seriously violated Party discipline, and the Party's 18-year-old still does not converge, do not collect hands, wind discipline, the nature of bad, serious.
After this case, after many media reports, become the focus case, the social impact is very bad.
In the immediate aftermath of the case, the leadership of the criminal investigation police of Haikou City Public Security Bureau attached great importance to it, and immediately organized a team of lean police officers to carry out the investigation.
The police immediately executed the suspect on the Internet, took a variety of measures, and contacted the field police to check the whereabouts of the king.
Since the suspect was a repeat offender, he was repeatedly dealt with by a public security organ, with a strong anti-reconnaissance capability, combined with his long-term drug use, frequent seizures during interrogation, and the difficulty of interrogation.
The Greenland shark, also known as the microcephaly shark, is widely distributed in the North Atlantic waters around Greenland and Iceland, reaching four to five metres long in adulthood.
But they are extremely slow to grow, sometimes only about 1 cm in a year, suggesting that Greenland sharks may have an exceptionally long lifespan.
Traditional measurement methods typically use calcified tissue in animals, which can be used in some sharks, but this calcified tissue is scarce in the Greenland shark.
The new study, led by Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, turned to a radiocarbon year using the lens of a Greenland shark's eye lens.
This method has previously been used to determine the age of the whale, but it is the first time it has been used to determine the age of fish such as sharks.
Their analysis shows that the largest shark life is estimated to be 392 years, with a margin of error of 120 years.
That said, the shark is at least 272 years old and could reach a maximum of 512 years.
In addition, a female Greenland shark is expected to mature about 4 metres in length, at least until at least 156 years of age.
The researchers therefore wrote in the paper that the Greenland shark is the most known and long-lived vertebrate on the planet, outpacing the previous long-lived champion, the Whale (211).
Over the past year, the results have been remarkable, the RMB exchange rate has remained basically stable, and it has also laid the foundation for the internationalization of the renminbi.
From the point of view of market performance, in the past year, the two-way floating rate of RMB exchange rate is obvious, the exchange rate is more elastic, and the exchange rate is expected to be stable.
So far, there has been a lot of fluctuation of the RMB over 100 points in the middle of the dollar, but the process has changed and changed.
The last exchange, which took place last year, was implemented in 2005, with a significant appreciation of the renminbi against the United States dollar during the decade.
Since the introduction of the new exchange, the renminbi has changed its previous state of appreciation, and the RMB exchange rate has depreciated by about 8 per cent in one year.
On 1 October this year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will formally accept the renminbi as a weighted currency.
This week, China's General Administration of Customs released statistics showing that the total value of China's imports and exports in the first seven months of this year was 13.21 trillion yuan, down 3 percent from the same period last year.
In the month of July, China's total imports and exports fell by only 0.9 per cent year-on-year, particularly as exports increased by 2.9 per cent year-on-year.
Experts believe that although there are signs of stabilization in July, there should be no excessive expectations.
In July, China's imports and exports totaled 2.09 trillion yuan, down 0.9 percent year-on-year.
Of that amount, 1.22 trillion yuan was exported, an increase of 2.9 per cent; the import of 87.3 billion yuan, a decrease of 5.7 per cent; and a trade surplus of 342.8 billion yuan, an increase of 34 per cent.
Although the total value of imports and exports continued to decline year-on-year, export data showed growth, which was the fifth consecutive monthly increase since March.
Shanghai police beat more than 3400 thieves in 4 months to crack down on "shoplifting" gang
At the same time as the investigation of the case, the police also recovered the stolen goods totalling more than 33 million yuan.
According to a statement made by members of the theft gang, they entered Shanghai from the field by means of a black car, then got out of the car, joined each other in a few hours, and then left for Shanghai.
In the course of the crime, the suspects often use a building as a unit, using the exterior wall to climb, the way from the top to the bottom of the "sweep building" theft.
Recently, the suspect has been transferred by Xuhui Public Security Bureau to the Xuhui District Public Prosecutor's Office for examination and prosecution.
The police remind the general public that it is important to lock the doors and windows of the home when going out, and recommends that the public should choose steel with hard materials.
In late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will travel to Kenya to attend the Sixth African Development Conference, according to the China Voice News Evening News.
The African Development Conference was led by Japan, and the previous five meetings were held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, so this meeting will also be the first to move to Africa.
In response, Japanese foreign ministry officials said the meeting on the ground in Africa had helped to draw the attention of African and European countries to Japan.
To coincide with Shinzo Abe's trip, according to Kyodo News, the Japanese Lib Dems will send a group of representatives to the countries concerned.
It is no coincidence that Japan's "regular" approach began in the early 1990s, when the African Development Conference, launched by Japan, also began in 1993.
Africa, with 53 seats in the United Nations, is an important ticket to the United Nations, and how can Japan abandon Africa if it wants to "get into it"?
There will also be an exchange of views with relevant national figures on the extremist organization "Islamic State" and the response to terrorist activities.
The "Western Group" will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau.
Japan's Foreign Minister Tian Wenxiong has also recently stated his intentions at the UN Security Council for the African Development Conference.
Abe announced here that for the stability of countries in sub-Saharan Africa, it would provide 100 billion yen (6.1 billion yuan) in aid over five years.
Observers generally agree that Japan's generosity to Africa has always had two main objectives: To increase Japan's sense of presence in Africa, and to win the support of African countries on the issue.
"From a political point of view, Africa, while relatively underdeveloped, has a relatively large number of countries, so Japan has always regarded it as a so-called 'big ticket field'," said Yang Bojiang, an expert on Japan.
Japan will not give up in the future, and the work on Africa will not be terminated and will be strengthened.
On the economic front, because of Japan's relatively strong production capacity, the domestic market is relatively limited, especially in the context of the ageing of young children, where domestic demand is relatively low.
However, from Junichiro Koizumi, 10 years ago, to Abe, 10 years later, Japan's repeated "sprints" have been unsuccessful.
Yang Bojiang, an expert on Japan, believes that Japan's intention is clear, but it will be difficult to get in the way.
In order to achieve its goals, Japan needs to have a good relationship with its neighboring countries, in which Japan needs to have a right attitude, whether in geopolitical disputes or in ethnic disputes and historical awareness.
The Haikou Maritime Court opened its case in the early hours of the morning to ensure the interests of the parties involved in the sinking of the fishing vessel
The relatives of the three deceased crew members rushed to the Haikou Maritime Court at 4 a.m. on 7 August to file an application for the seizure of a suspected hit-and-run cargo ship.

At 4: 20 a.m., the applicant referred to the pre-indictment property preservation, and the duty bailiff was patient.
This forum is chaired by the Deputy Dean of the School of Politics and Public Administration of Shandong University.
What are the challenges of globalization and integration of the world economy?
How does national governance adapt to a changing world?
At that time, he will conduct an all-round analysis of the above-mentioned issues.
He is deputy director and secretary-general of the Center for Global Governance Studies at Peking University and a former director of the office of Cornell University in Beijing.
The current research focuses on profound changes in the global political, economic, scientific, technological and cultural religions, as well as the opportunities and challenges that these changes pose to national governance, leadership and global governance.
Traditional practices introduce a new bright spot for the opening of the Hong Kong Vineyard Festival 2016
The loud music, the traditional little food, the fancy decorations, the rough scene of the crowd.
It will be held at Victoria Park from 12 to 14, hosted by the Hong Kong Chaotide Society, which is one of Hong Kong's most spectacular.
In addition to the continuation of the "competition for the orphans," the family will be able to participate in the "parent-child pot race."
It is not only in the form of cartoon to introduce the cultural history, the site also has a 3D self-filming area, traditional small food area and traditional craft mobile classroom, which attracts many children and overseas people to experience the visit.
A couple from France stayed at the event for nearly three hours and experienced it in a mini-card mobile classroom.
"Check it out online for this particular holiday, so decided to come and have a look and feel very fresh," he said.
They say that while France has a similar holiday to commemorate the first people, the atmosphere is heavy, unlike here, with music and food to learn traditional craft.
"In such a busy financial metropolis of Hong Kong," she said, "we can still see such a scale, organized ritual of ancestors."
"This not only reflects the plurality of Chinese culture, but also allows more people to understand these traditional craft and carry on."
"We don't want to make the Phelan cultural festival so horrible that people are afraid to approach them, especially young children," he said.
"We hope that through the youthful activities and layout of the site, young people will be aware of the filial piety and gratitude that lies behind the culture of the festival."
He said a total of 24 teams were involved, not only with associations, but also with a number of schools for students to attend.
It is understood that the Hong Kong Chapecoense will be included in the "National Intangible Cultural Heritage List" in 2011.
On the evening of the evening, China's Beijing Theatre carried a famous opera, "White Snake," to Mexico City, and at the National Palace of Fine Arts, the National Palace of Fine Arts presented an original Peking Opera feast for the local people.
From 9 to 23 August, China's National Beijing Theatre performed seven Peking Opera performances in Mexico City, Mexico City, and five cities, including Cordoba and Juarez.
The audience followed the plot of the "White Snake" plot, the actor's singing, sometimes a smile, and a standing ovation.
Marisa Jiménez Camacho, who watched the Beijing Opera show 15 years ago, watched the show with her daughter.
"It was a brilliant performance, and I was impressed by the music, the lighting, the stage performance, and I felt it was necessary for my daughter to learn about Chinese culture and Chinese opera art."
The enthusiasm of the Mexican audience impressed the white women and the young actors.
"I didn't think that the Mexican audience was so enthusiastic, and I had some concerns about whether they could understand the story, but today it was a surprise to see them capture the storyline and a lot of laughs."
China's ambassador to Mexico, Qiu Xiaoqi, said the cultural exchanges of this year's "China-Asia Cultural Exchange Year" have played an active role in promoting a better understanding and friendship between the two countries.
Next year will mark the forty-fifth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries, and more cultural exchanges will be held in China and Mexico.
Liu's visit to Sanya to study "double-repair, Twin Cities" in order to improve the level of urban construction management
On the morning of the 12th morning, Mr Lau chaired a symposium to hear reports on the progress of the "Twin Cities" pilot project in Sanaya and the inputs from the various departments concerned.
Liu has given full recognition to the milestones achieved in the pilot work and the good experience and good practices that have been created.
Liu stressed that Sanya should hold fast to the historical development opportunities, to "double-fix" the "Twin Cities" pilot as an important grasping hand, in the economic and social development of the province to give full play to the leading role of the demonstration.
We should play a leading role in raising the international level of the international tourist island, starting with a few details, enriching the international elements and creating international boutique.
It is necessary to play a leading role in urban and rural integration and whole-domain tourism, accelerate the construction of special-style towns, integrate tourism elements into each project, and build every village and town in Sanya as a tourist destination.
We should play a leading role in the "100 Days of Service Social Investment," promote a number of major projects and campus construction, ensure the landing of high-quality projects, and implement the requirements of large operations.
Provincial Standing Committee, Sanya Party Secretary Zhang Qi, deputy governor Wang Lu, provincial government secretary-general Lu Zhiyuan participated in the research talks.
Deng Yaping has won 18 world titles in 14 years of sport, becoming the first person to win four Olympic gold medals in China's Olympic history.
She has been the world number one in table tennis for eight consecutive years and is the world's longest-serving female athlete in the history of table tennis.
On 26 September 2010, he was the Vice-Secretary-General of the People's Daily and the General Manager of the People's Search Network Corporation.
Recently, she will join forces with Yu Minhong to build the country's first sports industry innovation platform.
There are also such a group of star coaches in the Chinese sports world: They have a great time in the athletes' era, winning countless glory for the country; after retiring, they have taught them for years to come back and win the championship.
As the first world champion of Chinese men's gymnastics, Huang Yu-bin chose to pick up the whip.
From the coach of the women's team to the coach of the men's team, to the head coach, Huang Yu-bin built an "Olympic gold regiment", the team in the Beijing Olympic Games achieved the myth of 9 gold 1 silver 4 copper.
Since then, Tian Liang has been advertising endorsements constantly, and in recent years has played the role of "Niang", "Lei Feng" and other important roles.
A lot of NBA players have proved their strength, but there has been a decline.
There are a number of players who have regressed each season, either because of the increase in age or the amount of time they play.
Of course, some "setbacks" may simply shrink the data, and the strength of these players may not decline.
Even if Wade is still one of the best scoring defenders in the league, his performance at the Bulldogs should not be as good as the Heat.
He and Londo have a limited back-field range, and when home star Butler's three-point shot is only 32.8 percent, the offense will be crowded next season.
Coming to Wind City, the Flash is bound to give the ball more to Butler and Londo, who are likely to choose to play in the regular season.
Oakford's situation was more awkward, as the 76ers' first choice last season, he had to compete with Simmons and Enid for time and ball in the new season.
The rivalry may not come soon, and Simmons will need to adapt to the NBA, and Enid will have to make a full recovery from the injury, but whether Oakford will have a place in the 76-man PFDJ is a problem.
Last season, Oakford's 32 percent score came from a low offense, a higher percentage than Kasimus, Vucevic and Brooke Lopez, while his usage was also high in the league's top 40.
As Simmons has shown the potential to hold the ball forward, Enid is in a better shape for an NBA game, and Oakford's status is unlikely to be as solid again.
Thompson's usage has stabilized in the league's top 20 in the past two seasons, and it was the best two seasons of his career.
The problem, though, is that, with Durant's arrival, Thompson's usage is bound to fall, which is bound to affect his play.
The impact will not only affect the number of shots, but Townsend's run-of-the-ball offense will certainly be significantly reduced next season, which in some ways will make it less difficult for opponents to defend against him.
Durant's arrival must have shrunk the numbers of the Warriors players, but the worst of it would be Thompson.
But that doesn't mean that Townsend's level has regressed, which is more like the sacrifice he made for the team as a whole.
Parker did better last season than the data reflected, not only because his basketball efficiency came to the top of his career, and his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs.
Duncan retired, Ginobili announced another year, and the GDP mix eventually came to an end, and as the youngest of the three, there wasn't much oil in the tank of the French sports car.
After getting a third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell have won more regular-season MVP than James, and Jordan is the only FMVP than James.
Oh, by the way, James has just brought Cleveland the first professional sports championship of the past 52 years.
James, who reached the 14th season of his career, needs to be better assured of physical strength to prepare for the playoffs.
As a result, James' data is likely to fall further during the regular season, and he will put more of the burden on Owen to take the lead, though he will still easily become a top-three player in the league.
"It is important to develop the talent that has been learned from the country in Russia."
At 12: 00 local time, Huang Jing, president of the Overseas Chinese Federation of Moscow, said with excitement when he saw the reporter.
A short time ago, she attended a training course on Chinese talent (calligraphy, painting) of overseas Chinese cultural associations, hosted by the Office of Overseas Chinese Affairs of the State Council of China and hosted by the University of China.
Having just attended the training course, I had no idea what to do with the book, and after the training session, he was able to draw out and write his own work.
When we return to Moscow, we must use the knowledge and skills we have learned to make their own contributions to the dissemination and promotion of Chinese culture.
The same feeling was felt by the Secretary-General of the Russian Society for the Promotion of Chinese Culture, who also attended the course.
She says she has made great progress with the help of a training teacher, and is also feeling the burden of being an "overseas communicator of Chinese culture."
He said he wanted to spread and promote the traditional Chinese culture among the Chinese and the Russians who love Chinese culture.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The British team won silver in the seven-man rugby sevens team and the Fiji team won the gold medal
In the seven-man rugby sevens final on Thursday night, the British team failed to extend their outstanding performance in front of the Fiji team, which was defeated by the Fijian team 43-7 at Rio Todoro Stadium.
The Fiji team won the gold medal with an unassailable performance in ball control, robbery, avoidance, cooperation, running and strength, the country's first ever Olympic medal.
Silver was a big consolation for the defeated British team, who won the third silver medal of the day, which was enough to make the British rugby team proud: They beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa in the seven-man rugby sevens tournament for the first time.
Earlier in the day, the British team topped the South African team with a 7-5 victory that could have affected their status in the final.
But in any case, the current Fijian team is good enough to beat a spirited 15-man team.
Tomorrow, at least one Briton will be wearing a gold medal, which may be a consolation for the British team, but it may not be either: This Englishman is Ben Ryan, the head coach of the Fiji team from Wimbledon, who has served as head coach of the British team.
It is not easy for the British team to achieve today's results.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's coaching, they had not tasted success in the international seven-man rugby league in Adelaide.
And now, they're just one step away from the title.
Although they have been dealt a huge blow, they have made very impressive progress.
Fiji took advantage in the opening round, leaving the British team with nothing to offer.
For Tom Mitchell and his team-mates, it was like bumping into a series of on-going buses, and the World Series championship team had already taken a 5-0 lead when the Orioles swept into the corner flag zone.
The game lasted just four minutes, and Jerry Tuohy scored again on the right wing.
At 12-0, the British team barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's strong interception gave the Giants general Leon Caravagawa no third score, but that only slowed Fiji's scoring.
In seven minutes, Yasa Veselema hit a touchdown in the right corner, 17-0, and the British team added insult to injury.
That Carrava got another point, and the game... the first half was still one minute.
Then he broke through the English team's defence and went straight to the scoring line.
At halftime, the score was already 29-0.
The Fijians seem to have been born to play seven-man rugby, and the British team is still in its infancy.
That's how it is.
The British team made a huge change in the second half and hit the Fijian defence in four minutes, and it was a good performance in the first half, but then the Fijian team played brilliantly, scored again by Joshua Tuesova.
Dan Norton created the scoring opportunity for the British team, who hit the ground in the left corner to change the score to 36-7, but the game had long been in the hands of the South China Sea island nation, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the platform.
The wonderful performance of the Fiji team had to be applauded.
Mara Williams blocked an indifferent attack from the Fijian team in the final moments.
As the final whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced, and the defeated British team could only regret their exit.
Earlier in the day, the Fiji team beat Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, while England narrowly beat South Africa in a bitter semi-final.
Kyle Brown helped the South African team take the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton scored in the second half with a superb foot pass.
After that, England's Anthony's brother Marcus Wesson secured the team's victory with a brilliant interception, and eventually the British team won the silver medal.
Helen Graf and Heather Stanning inspired by cancer-stricken coach to win rowing gold
It is no exaggeration to say that this is the most moving gold medal.
From the start of the first paddle to the present, Helen Graf and Heather Stanning have been trained in 220 punitive canvases, and the gold medal they won at Estacio da Lagoa has a more extraordinary meaning.
While there were only two of them, there was another man on the boat, the coach, Robin Williams, who accompanied them to the second consecutive women's double sculls Olympic gold medal, the first women's rowing team to reach that height.
They have maintained a 39-game unbeaten streak with an absolute advantage.
What we have seen is that these two talented athletes walk gracefully on the water, but that's not the whole point of this victory.
There was a lot of voluntary help behind every rowing gold medal, and it was their constant dedication that made the difference, and there was nothing more to help than a coach who learned of his cancer 30 months ago and didn't know if he could live to see it.
As he said, death could come at any time.
I had bladder cancer and they had surgery for me.
If they do not operate, the cancer cells will spread throughout the body.
In this way, the situation would be much worse.
This will change your view slightly.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he began treatment in early 2014 to minimise the impact, although it may not be appropriate to say so in this case.
I need to get paid, so I must hurry up.
It was an inspiration for me.
I lived in the hospital, and although they said it was enough to walk a few steps, I walked 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet every time I walked around the ward.
That's where it all started.
Rowing itself is a journey, and that makes the journey a bit longer.
At the moment of gold, they first thought of Williams. This morning Williams was a little more talkative than usual in order to overcome his anxiety.
"I'm in a bad mood this week, probably a little extreme, but this gold medal is really remarkable," she said.
It has repeatedly told me how important this is to me, how much effort I, Helen and Robin have made.
It was the return of Helen, Robin and me for three years.
If we don't have Robin, we're just nobody. Thank him very much. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have found a better trainer and coach than him.
Helen Graf and Heather Stanning have not tasted defeat in five years.
The penalties set by this combination are unmatched by their opponents.
Even in the final 500 meters, when New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Graf had plenty of physical reserves.
It was breathtaking at the time.
Helen cried: "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It's really important not to be influenced by your opponent.
We have a good start, and at the same time we are not looking forward to great things.
We didn't think about the glory today, we just wanted to scratch each oar and win the game, and we did it.
The pair spent a year deciding their own future.
Graf will be married to TV adventurer Steve Buckchal next month.
Now, though, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don't want to say it's my last game.
It's going to put too much pressure on me.
In London, it took me about six months to realise I was an Olympic champion.
It was a whole new experience, and I felt very nervous.
It's been about four minutes now.
"I feel much better," she said.

Compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015), the average annual inflation rate for the past 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) was -0.8% (as measured by the consumer price index).
Compared to June 2016, the consumer price index for July 2016 was 101.0 per cent, or 1.0 per cent for the month.
The inflation rate so far this year (July 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2%, compared with July 2015, when the annual inflation rate was -0.2%.

Snapchat's' anime 'effect is meant to satirize Asians
Snapchat says the filter is inspired by anime, but some observers think it has racial overtones.
Snapchat's 150 million daily users can change reality through their filter tools and make people look ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a Roy Lichtenstein picture.
These lenses have the effect of passivation, bending features, and produce more than 30 million modified selfies a day.
Any missteps will be immediately brought to the attention of the public.
The Snapchat lens has been criticized for agitating to play black people or beauty with white skin.
So when the app this week provided some users with a filter that could create slant eyes, odd teeth, and powder-face effects, some critics called it a racial satire on Asian "yellow."
They even think that these recurring problems mean the company has a bigger problem with diversity.
Reports from The Verge and Motherboard on Wednesday sparked outrage after Snapchat said it deleted the feature.
The company's explanation: The filter is a tribute to anime characters, not satirical Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of the hurtful stereotype of reality.
Others are also adamantly opposed to these anime images.
A Korean-American art student, who tweeted about the photos and was widely shared, said in an email that the filters were "at least upsetting and uncomfortable."
"It's hard to tell the difference between an extremely disgusting Asian satirical image and the effect of a filter," she added.
Although the filter is not just yellow, the yellow race is extremely demeaned.
Snapchat is not the only company to touch these cultural bottom lines.
From company boards to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, American culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusiveness.
Snapchat's large group of young people can be very sensitive because they are more ethnically diverse than the older generation.
When one of Snapchat's filters produced an insulting image of the user, 25-year-old Zhu Katy said in an interview on Thursday: "Compared to before, this kind of thing is more out of sight."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article written for Medium and a phone interview, she said she thought the race controversy reflected a lack of racial diversity in Snapchat's hiring process.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's staff as mostly white, the leadership was all male and added a hashtag at the end of the article: # DeleSnapchat.
As a Chinese-American, Ms Zhu said: "Either they don't have people of color in their staff to make such a decision, or there are some people of color in their staff, but their positions don't allow them to speak up."
Other observers shared complaints that she had not been responded to by Snapchat.
The company did not release data on employee diversity and said it was a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial background of its employees, but a spokesman said the company had recently hired a recruiter specifically to focus on people with lower internal ratios and work to promote internal inclusiveness.
Ms Zhu said she would close her Snapchat account: "I wonder if they need more users like us who oppose this behavior."
Military officials distort ISIS intelligence, congressional panel says
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel noted that U.S. Central Command officials changed intelligence reports, describing the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as more optimistic than it actually was.
The interim report comes from a special working group set up by the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee's defense sub-committee. The report said there was "widespread dissatisfaction" among intelligence analysts at the Central Command, who said their superiors were tampering with their assessment of the battle between the United States and the Islamic State.
Central Command (Centcom), based in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news report on the report, "intelligence vetted by senior leaders of the Central Command is more optimistic about U.S. counter-terrorism operations than it actually is, and has always been more optimistic than other intelligence agencies" analysis. "
"The conduct of the Central Command is unacceptable," said the representative of the Republican Party of California. "On the other hand, our fighters are suffering from the war, and on the other side are high-level policymakers who receive the wrong analysis."
The issue of the leadership of the Central Command has been extended to the highest levels of the institution.
The report detailed the long-standing problems of Central Command in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analyzing U.S. training of Iraqi forces.
While there is no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered changes to the reports, according to the report's description, the analysts felt they were under pressure from the leaders of the Central Command to make more optimistic comments about the threat of ISIS or IS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command's press releases, statements and congressional testimony were much more optimistic than they actually were," the report said.
For example, a Central Command official publicly expressed the possibility that a major military operation could be taken to retake Mosul as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of investigation, this outcome is already evident," Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most of the top intelligence officers at U.S. Central Command manipulated the command's intelligence products to hide the threat from ISIS.
The Republican Party formed a dedicated working group after learning from analysts that information about ISIS had been manipulated.
As the investigation continues, more discoveries will be made following the release of the report on Thursday.
The Attorney-General of the Ministry of Defence has also conducted a long-term investigation of the Central Command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released its findings on Thursday, in line with some of the conclusions of the GOP's dedicated working group.
"Between 2014 and 2015, the Central Command developed an overly narrow process for intelligence assessments of ISIS and Iraq's peacekeeping forces," the committee's Democratic leader said in a statement.
Mr Shepherd said the process was "hindering the release of intelligence," lowering analyst morale and "not being able to accept different opinions."
But Mr. Shea and the Democrats also said they had found no evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on Central Command analysts, so that their conclusions were consistent with a "default or political narrative."
The Daily Beast reported the preliminary results of a congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon attorney general began an investigation after receiving a complaint from a Central Command analyst.
Navy Major Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department did not comment on the congressional report until the attorney general's investigation was not concluded.
But he said: "Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence encourage a healthy dialogue on these important national security themes."
The impact of the inquiry has outweighed the success of the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria (increasingly claimed by Defense Department officials).
But last year, the claims led the public to question the extent to which President Obama could trust the Central Command's assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of ISIS intelligence is reminiscent of the controversy more than a decade ago, when Central Command intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article noting that George W. Bush's administration, despite opposition from many analysts, insisted on sending small troops to Iraq and barely considering the post-2003 invasion.
Mr Hooker played a key role in this opposition campaign on ISIS intelligence.
Last year, officials said that Mr. Hooker's team had concluded that the airstrikes against the Islamic State refinery did not significantly reduce the economic income of the terrorist organization, which built makeshift refineries to continue to sell oil on the black market, in contrast to the announcement.
According to a September report in the Times, the Central Command did not release the findings.
Central Command Commander Lloyd Austin III was criticized last year after multiple lawyers reviewed Senate testimony about an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and is currently replaced by Joseph Vettel for his position at Central Command.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The United States won a four-game winning streak in the women's hockey tournament, which will be a showdown with Britain
In a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Baum led the U.S. women's hockey team on Thursday, helping the U.S. team to a 3-0 victory over India.
After scoring five goals in two games, the 27-year-old said she did not know she had such a good performance.
"I don't know anything about it," she said.
I'm not the kind of person who will remember that I've scored a couple of goals.
What she knows is that the U.S. team has a four-game winning streak in the Olympics and will compete with the team in a 2-0 victory over Japan on Thursday.
Britain and the United States face each other in the first round of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams advanced to the quarter-finals, a match that will determine who comes first in the group.
The team with the first team will avoid encountering a strong Dutch team so they can go even further. The Dutch are in the same group as the other team.
On Saturday, the U.S. team worked wonders with an astonishing performance, knowing that the U.S. team was at the bottom of 12 teams at the London Games four years ago.
Baum was also in the team at the time.
Baum grew up in Braubell, Pa., and first picked up a hockey stick at the age of three (her twin sister worked on the sport at Drake) and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming the youngest member of the national team to date.
Having failed to make the final list, she missed the 2008 Olympics.
In 2012, neither she nor her teammates were viewed favorably.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parham was the head coach and everything started to change.
"This is a change in culture, mentality and substance," Mr Baum said.
We were not at the current level in London at the time.
We had a complete roll-over.
On Thursday night, Baum opened the scoring with a close-range backhand shot in the first half.
India had not tasted victory in the tournament, but the team showed incredible tenacity and held the 1-0 lead to the end of the third quarter, when Bam broke out.
She carried the ball along the left side of the field, then cut into the middle and shot into the net, giving the US a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The United States beat goalkeeper Jackie Briggs for the first time in the tournament, scoring one goal in each of the first three victories.
This time she was overplayed.
So did Baum.
"We're in good shape right now," Parham said, "but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
The cold-acid food of the Great Depression during a big meal
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had just been elected president, sat in the Oval Office for lunch.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt liked the delicacies of Fifth Avenue, such as foie gras and Maryland braised water fish.
That day, his menu was very simple: Ketchup devil eggs, mashed potatoes and fruit pudding as a snack.
"This is to share in the food with the people who are suffering," says Jane Ziegman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It also embodies the American way of eating."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Spotlight," was about Chinese food in the United States, and Ms. Ziegman, in her book "97 Orchard," told stories about the lives of slum tenants through food.
They co-wrote a new book, "A hearty meal," to be published on Tuesday by Harper's Press, a book about the history of food in the United States during the Great Depression.
After showing some common insight on food, they met a reporter at the sandwich shop in Eisenberg, a simple lunch counter in the Iron District that has been in business since 1929, when the economy collapsed.
Ms. Ziegman, 54, ordered a cream cheese with a chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and a vegetable dish.
The reporter ordered a meat roll, which the couple thought was appropriate to discuss the Depression-era diet.
"Bread was very popular at the time," Ms. Ziegman said.
There was peanut bread, liver bread, soy bread at the time.
They are all made with a raw material and a cheap watering head that can be poured over the raw material.
Imagine that your dinner is all peanuts.
Mr. Coe made a strange appearance.
"They're definitely like lead in your stomach," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, American Downton was a buffet, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cook meals for male farm workers, with freshly tested pies for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
During the First World War, it was the Americans who gave their food to the hungry Europeans. "A hearty meal" chronicled how the country suddenly ceased to be a land of abundance.
Mr Coe explained why he and his wife were going to write the book: "At the time, food had become the main topic that made Americans unhappy."
Another unpleasant topic was the shabby new food: "Fan food" such as bread and stews became the main course, and the stew was "the best form of leftovers cooking," Ms. Ziegman said, because chefs could use the cream in the sauce to cover up the hard-to-eat ingredients.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dried fruit.
The meat, which has been featured on the American dinner table for years, has become a rare luxury.
The odd mash-up only considers calories, and the first thing people think about is nutrition compared to taste or even basic culinary common sense.
In a study of the book, including various recipes, Ms. Ziegman produced a roasted onion stuffed with peanut oil.
"It's not common at the dinner table," Mr. Koko said.
"It's too strange," Ms Ziegman said.
Peanut oil can't be paired with roasted onions.
This is a feature of many family economic meals.
Family economists have influenced the country's eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, who served as head chef of the Federal Bureau of Family Economics from 1923 to 1943, which is unique in history.
They have published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines to encourage women to "be careful" and have the courage to make bad foods such as butter pasta and carrots.
"A hearty meal" is a hearty "historical treasure."
It is especially worth playing with the government's response to hungry people, such as President-elect Herbert Hoover's "I can't handle the other."
Although he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse in his childhood, his diet was as refined as a millionaire.
"He likes to eat European-style Western food, such as fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Koko said.
He was wearing an evening dress and dining in a gilded dining room.
He was clearly separated from the people.
If it wasn't for his wife, Eleanor, who encouraged him to set an example on his diet, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
As the book says, the butler hired by Ms. Roosevelt has no interest in taste, so the White House's "food is not only the most difficult food in Washington, but the worst food."
As soon as the United States returned to normal, many of the Great Depression cooking styles were abandoned.
Ms Ziegman said what was left was our focus on calories and nutrition and the application of science to cooking.
The couple said that in writing the book, they learned more about Ms. Ziegman's mother's eating habits, such as how she didn't throw the food away.
"She was very afraid of wasting food," Mr. Koko said.
"She actually made a lot of people sick," Ms. Ziegman recalled.
For example, there has been a "cream puffs" event.
After removing the plates, she and Mr. Coe took out a dessert they had prepared at home: This was the fruit pudding that President Roosevelt had eaten at lunch.
"It's called the cream fruit," Ms. Ziegman said, adding that it was "the usual trick" to make a trendy name for a common dish.
There is no raw cream in this dessert, only dried fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone struggled to get the spoon deep into the sticky brown paste.
Surprisingly, the dessert still tastes good.
Mr. Coe took the second spoonful and the third spoonful.
He felt it was an acceptable dessert and told his wife: "It would be more delicious to add some chopped walnuts."
Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report showed that crude oil production continued to increase in July, with Saudi production hitting a record high.
The report does not ban the market from casting doubt on OPEC's credibility, and the road to a recovery in oil prices is likely to remain thorny.
OPEC will hold an informal meeting on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum on September 26-28, OPEC Chairman-in-Office and Qatar Energy Minister Saada Saada said on Monday.
Overall OPEC production, including Gabon, rose 4.6 million barrels per day to 331.1 million barrels per day in July, according to a monthly report released by OPEC on Wednesday.
OPEC also said in its monthly report that low crude oil prices had prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil, adding to the market's oversupply.
As a result, international oil prices fell for the second consecutive day, combined with an unexpected increase in U.S. crude oil production and an unexpected increase in crude oil inventories.
As of Wednesday's close, light crude futures for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange were down 2.48 per cent, and London Brent crude futures for October delivery were down 2.07 per cent.
Reuters believes the proposed meeting of oil-producing nations is unlikely to significantly tighten supply, and data released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration have weighed on sentiment.
On Wednesday, Iran's official news agency, Fars, quoted Iran's oil minister, Gonzaga, as saying Iran's daily crude oil production was at a maximum of 3.85 million bpd, the highest level since 2008.
As news of the meeting emerged, Russian Energy Minister Novak said there was no need for a new round of freeze talks under the current oil price.
The last meeting of oil-producing countries was already the case in April, when OPEC members failed to agree on any measure.
Emma Richards, an oil and gas analyst at BMIResearch, said the market and the media may have overreacted to OPEC's upcoming meeting.
Helima Croft, head of commodities strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC was changing the mood of the market by releasing signals that they would contribute to the agreement.
The device is like a smoke and a mirror that opens the eyes of a person (deliberately giving the wrong impression).
Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank, said it was thought that OPEC's chances of trying to stabilize the market through the September meeting were low.
This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, which has, after all, been a "wolf."
All over the world to publish medical advertisements, report complaints in a centralized manner, and have been repeatedly punished by the medical institutions as the focus of the spot checks.
The National Health Planning Commission and the State Administration of Chinese Medicine will, in due course, organize supervision and inspection of the special supervision and inspection work in some provinces.
As a result of the massive influx of capital into Internet medicine, which caused the current homogenization of products, the investment boom retreated and capital entered the wait-and-see period, according to media reports.
There has also been a spate of deaths of Internet-based healthcare companies within a year of the start-up, and about 20 percent of start-up Internet-based healthcare companies no longer exist, according to data from the Centre for Management Research at the University of Hong Kong.
However, at a time when most internet-based healthcare firms are struggling to secure financing on the Awheel or the Bend, there are several areas where leading firms can still get a capital boost.
It seems that the Internet medical start-up should not be "a nest of bees", but to see the market demand, sink the heart to do, do deep.
The stock accounted for 40 per cent of the registered capital and $1800.00 million, or 60 per cent of the registered capital.
In recent years, with the state's policy support in medical information, the electronic and integrated supply chain management system has gradually entered all levels of hospitals.
This cooperation with Kyushu is aimed at the demand of the market, to help the hospital set up an advanced supply chain management system, and as an opportunity to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many Internet-based healthcare companies, iBaby was initially focused on the vertical field of internet obstetrics, deep-ploughing pregnant women and doctors at both ends.
Pregnant mothers not only have free 24-hour and one-on-one doctor visits, but also pay for targeted medical consultations.
And at the doctor's end, iBaby breaks geographical limits by taking the form of online lectures, peer-to-peer exchanges, case discussions and other micro-lectures by organizing experts to grassroots doctors.
At present, three plates are opened for doctors to continue their education, doctors, and doctors for help.
Offers include online learning, case discussions, academic exchanges, social platforms with hospitals, doctors and doctors, legal aid, entrepreneurial support and other services needed for a doctor-patient relationship or personal life.
According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently said Ali's health was "willing to settle down" to take down big health data.
Internet companies, data companies lack of professional, on the same word on the writing method is not uniform.
Ali's current layout in the area of medical health is divided into three parts: Ali Health, Skycat Medicine and Alipay Future Hospital.
"It's not just a matter of how much money," Wang said. "It's not just a matter of how much money you have.
It's easy to damage the heart by staying up late to watch the Olympic Games
Brazil's Olympic Games are in full swing, and even in the middle of the night when the event is broadcast, many citizens will stay up late to watch.
In response, doctors are particularly reminded that staying up late to watch the event is a health hazard that can trigger cardiovascular disease.
If you stay up late for a long period of time, the hormone will still be secreted, and the person is in a constant state of intense excitement, unable to get a normal recovery, causing blood vessels to contract and blood pressure to rise, causing cardiovascular disease.
People with high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood fat, smoking habits, family history and other cardiovascular risk factors are more likely to cause cardiovascular disease if they stay up late.
If you stay up for long periods of time, not only will cardiovascular function be affected, but the stomach function, the immune system, the neuroendocrine system will all be affected, and even the risk of tumors increases.
For older friends, Han Zhiyuan suggests, try not to stay up late in order to watch the Olympic Games, especially those with a history of cardiovascular disease.
During the last World Cup, Han Zhiyuan visited a 60-year-old patient whose myocardial infarction was triggered or related to staying up late to watch the game.
So far this year, his department has seen a number of patients with myocardial infarction or stroke around the age of 25, which is largely a result of the patient's long stay.
Do not stay up every day, occasionally stay up late to watch the favorite sports, other items may wait the next day to see the replay.
2. When you stay up late to replenish the water and eat more fruit, you can prevent the blockage of blood vessels and enhance the body's immunity.

The film is expected to debut on CCTV and Lego early next year, and will also debut the VR Panorama documentary.
The documentary "Polar" is a large-scale work focusing on the third polar plateau of the Earth, with a new perspective on the blend of Tibetan tradition and modernity, and the story of Tibet's interaction with the world.
The greatest advantage of VR works is to give the viewer a unique view of the "immersive" feeling, which also poses a higher requirement for the filming process.

On August 11, the Yantai detachment of the armed police of Shandong Province organized a high temperature of 34 degrees Celsius to carry out the jungle training in Kunyu mountain.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union brought missiles into Cuba, which nearly led to a nuclear war.
The event was seen as the pinnacle of the Cold War, known as the "Cuban Missile Crisis."
But what is little known is that, also during the Cold War, a strong solar storm nearly led to a U.S. nuclear war against the Soviet Union, an event that was not first published by researchers until August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm caused intense interference with the U.S. military's radar and radio communications in the Arctic.
The radars are part of a U.S. ballistic missile warning system used to monitor Soviet missiles.
The paper, completed by researchers at the University of Colorado in the United States, interviewed US military personnel involved in forecasting and analyzing solar activity at the time and consulted non-confidential literature.
In the 1960s, in an effort to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly launching a nuclear war, the US Air Force always had a number of warplanes carrying nuclear warheads flying in the sky, the paper wrote.
The U. S. military commander did not know that the culprit was the solar storm, not the Soviet Union, and ordered the warplanes to enter combat readiness.
Fortunately, the US military's solar activity, which began in the late 1950s and its research into the electromagnetic interference of the Earth, ultimately prevented this potential military conflict.
Later, he summarized the information provided by the United States Air Force Aviation Weather Service and submitted a detailed report.
The immediate consequence of this solar storm is that the U.S. military has since viewed space weather as a combat concern and built a more robust space weather forecasting system.
In day-to-day travel, people find that love cars are blocked by strange vehicles and can be used to solve this problem when they are not connected to the driver of an unfamiliar vehicle.
From 11 August, Xi'an traffic police micro-letter service "Xi'an traffic police" launched the "micro-letter moving" service.
After the launch of the service, citizens can solve such problems by using the "micro-mail" function in the event of an unfamiliar vehicle obstructing their vehicle when they are not on site.
This new service function is fast, save administrative cost; second, respect and protect the privacy of citizens; third, all-weather, full-time service.
As long as the public has a micro-letter, it is very convenient to operate on its own, in a way that makes it easier for both parties to "meet," to ease parking problems, and to reduce vehicle-related security cases.
On the other hand, in the case of car owners who refuse to park their cars or break the law, Xi said that the traffic police will take different measures to deal with the situation on the basis of the actual situation.
On 9 August, a group of more than 10 young workers from the Commercial Loop Power Company came here to carry out the theme of "Meet the Power of the Old Town" and the theme of our festival.
In combination with the work of the construction of spiritual civilization, the company of Danfeng County, a company of power supply company, has been active in organizing the "Emotional Power of the Old Town" and the theme of our festival.
"Our main focus is on work and learning, lack of time and platform to communicate with colleagues and friends," said the company's employees.
"This company has provided us with such a relaxed, happy and harmonious platform, which I like very much, meaningful and interesting."
The event was well received by young workers in the field, and it was hoped that the company would organize such activities to enhance communication and communication with many other young people.
The high-profile Beijing Olympic men's singles champion, Spanish superstar Nadal on the same day in the men's singles match in two sets to win the top eight, the men's doubles competition also advanced to the final.
As the Golden Slam winner, Nadal, to the Olympic Games, the injury did not heal him, this three-line attack, a lot of success.
He and team-mate Lopez will compete for gold in the men's doubles final with Romanian players Tekau and Meegan.
The women's singles event at the Rio Olympics came up against a number of seeded players, and after a few days of intense competition, the women's top four came out on top.
Kvitova will compete with Puig for a ticket to the final, while another finals berth will be between Keith and Corbell.
The top four of the women's doubles match were also produced in the semi-finals: Hingis / Bashinsky vs Herdka / Herbalova; Makarova / WeisNina vs Strycova / Seflova.
The mixed doubles match of the day also came out of the top eight, but the drop-off of the top seed, Ma Hu / Garcia, and the withdrawal of the Pac-12, slightly overshadowed the mixed doubles match.
On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly released a new version of the US-Japan Defense Cooperation Guidelines in New York, allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role globally.
This is the same day U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Japan's Minister for Foreign Affairs Tian Wenxiong and Japan's Defense Minister Zhonggu Yuan attend a news conference in New York.
This is the fifth time that a Chinese folk think tank has published an assessment report on Japan's military strength, and the fourth time it has launched the English version.
The report consists of nine chapters, including general policy adjustments, military strength, defence budget, military deployment, weaponry, institutional development, military training, foreign military security cooperation and military security relations with China.
According to the report, 2015 was the year of the Abe administration's phase-out of major policy adjustments in the area of security for several years.
Since then, Japan's initiatives in the area of security will be primarily at the operational level, such as the application of the rule of law, strategic follow-up and policy implementation, rather than the drastic adjustments and changes in frameworks, mechanisms and policies.
The report emphasizes that Abe's cabinet is trying to make a breakthrough through the above three points, to promote Japan's "normal nationalisation," the self-defense forces to go out and intervene in international security matters, strengthen the Japanese-American alliance, and defend China's multiple objectives.
Previously, the China Council for the Promotion of Strategic Culture issued an assessment of the military forces of Japan on 5 June 2012, 19 July 2013, 23 July 2014 and 30 June 2015.

Short board for public sports facilities
The black coal-yard warehouse turned into a "green grass" football field; the red-brick-topped plant turned into a modern sports pavilion.
On the National Fitness Day, the South Lok Ma Camp Sports Culture Park outside the Wangjiang River, Hangzhou, unveils the mysterious veil.
It used to be a coal field that has been idle since it closed more than a decade ago, leaving a lot of illegal construction and living rubbish.
As a result, it has become a sports culture park and will be opened to the public in November, providing free sports facilities to the public, and has undoubtedly opened up a new fertile ground for the sport.
This can not help but reminiscent of Hangzhou Chen's body school, the Chinese swimming pool "Huangpu Military Academy" swam out of a number of world champions.
There is a steady stream of swimmers, a vivid interpretation of the relationship between competitive sports and sports for all - the rich base of the masses provides good conditions for the selection of professional players.
The level of competitive sports is closely related to the basis of the sport, which depends on the sport in a certain sense.
According to reports, as of 2015, our country's per capita sports venues, although already 150 times the size of the founding of New China, still lag far behind the sporting powers.
In June, the State Department issued the National Fitness Plan (2016-2020), which will focus on the development of mass sports.
In order to make up the short board, on the one hand, the relevant departments should take full account of the layout of the stadiums in the city planning.
On the other hand, established public stadiums, including those in units such as schools, should be as open and as efficient as possible.
The Rio Olympics, which are now in full swing, inspire enthusiasm and a sense of participation.
Gilliard gets attorney fees for hepatitis C patent battle with Merck
According to a U.S. District Judge's judgment, Gillette Scientific is entitled to the attorney's fees incurred in a hepatitis C patent lawsuit with the pharmaceutical company Merck Group.
In June, after a U.S. judge found that Merck had committed an illegal act, including perjury and other unethical behavior, Gillette was exempted from paying $200 million in compensation for two patents from Gilliard's best-selling drugs, Soibuvir and Halvori.
In Thursday's lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Beth Lamborson Freeman said Gilliard did not have to bear the costs incurred by the defense.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gillette, which rules the next generation of the hepatitis C drug market, and the drug could cure more than 90 percent of hepatitis patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilliard and Merck sued each other, with both claiming to be the active ingredient in Gilliard's drug, the owner of the lab work in Soibuvir.
Us-backed forces announce they have recaptured Manbij from Islamic State
A force spokesman said on Friday that the remaining ISIS soldiers in the city had all left, and that US-backed forces had taken full control of the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border.
Following the departure of militants hiding in the city, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now sweeping the city.
Sharon Darwish, of the Manbij Military Council of the Syrian Democratic Forces, told Reuters they had rescued more than 2,000 civilians who had been hijacked by the militants.
"Manby season is now all under our control, but we're still carrying out sweeps," he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent in federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2105 tax returns on Friday, revealing that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a 34.2 percent federal tax.
In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, most of them to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton paid nearly $5.3 million, while the former secretary of state earned $3 million from publishers Simon and Schuster for a book about her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holden, released 10 years of tax returns.
The pair paid a 20.3 percent federal tax in 2015.
Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine will continue to be a benchmark for financial transparency, "Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump carried out a cover-up on false grounds and retracted his previous pledge to publish his tax returns.
While the law does not require it, in accordance with established practice, US presidential candidates should make public their tax returns.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyers cited the IRS audit as a reason for refusing to release their tax returns.
Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams tweeted that it was up to you and attached a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release his tax returns until the audit is complete.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republicans, say Trump's refusal to release tax returns raises questions about its net worth, charitable donations, business deals and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton seized on the issue, releasing a web video on Friday highlighting high-profile Democrats urging Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, she raised the issue in an economic policy speech in Michigan.
"For decades, he has refused to release his tax returns like any other presidential candidate," she told the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump had barely paid a penny in taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, all of whom said the current situation might still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a big issue in the presidential race.
Clinton has made a provision in the name of a billionaire investor, Warren Buffett, to guarantee that people earning more than $1 million a year pay at least a 30 percent tax.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Mr. Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he is also being audited by the IRS, and that Trump is "scared" not by the tax authorities, but by the voters.
The earliest tax returns released by the Clinton campaign group were in 2007.
The Clintons, who currently live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, with a combined tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The Clintons' 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, they earn as little as $100.
Their main investment was the low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons had $109,000 in dividends and interest income.

Jewish filmmaker criticises Berlin hotel for removing Israeli phone code in line with Arab customers "request - Reuters News
A French filmmaker with Jewish roots has revealed to the media that the Kempinski Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's phone code, and that hotel employees said it was in line with the "demands" of Arab customers, prompting an uproar.
Claude Lanzman, the author of the Jewish Holocaust documentary "Shoah," expressed his disappointment at the Kempinski Hotel and published an open letter in Germany's Frankfurt Report.
During a recent check-in, Lanzman wanted to find Israel on a list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
But Israel does not have a list of countries where guests can speak directly from the room.
Did Israel disappear in the German capital Berlin in 2016?
Lanzman wrote.
Instead, guests can call Israel through the Kempinski Hotel's call center.
Seeking an explanation, the filmmaker asked the front desk of the hotel.
In his letter, Lanzman said he was "shocked" by the answers he received at the front desk.
Hotel staff said it was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski Hotel."
And the reason for doing so makes the filmmaker angry.
Lanzman cited the employee's original words: Most of our guests were Arabs, and they asked for the Israeli code to be removed. "
According to the Nande Daily, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Haddas Handelsmann, called the incident "a disgrace."
We were surprised to learn of the incident.
This is a huge shame in itself.
What happened in Germany and the hotel chain was even more humiliating.
There is no need for any explanation.
"We want the hotel to come to the right conclusion," the official said.
The incident sparked a heated debate online, which everyone saw as a scandal.
It has been suggested that the Kempinski Hotel is simply "kowtowing" to meet the demands of Arab customers.
Another post pointed out that the hotel "really doesn't have a face," and pointed out that the high street in the famous city of Kendamm was near a synagogue.
According to Der Spiegel, the hotel was quick to clarify all the allegations, claiming that everything was "negligent" and "apologised" to Lanzman.
The Nande Daily quoted Kempinski as saying: "There has never been a direct order to remove Israel from the fast dial list."
The paper also says Israeli code has been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesting Brazilian students
Students clash with police during a protest against the reform of the government's public education system in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to evict the protesters.
The incident came as law enforcement officials tried to disperse the students, so police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the march to express their dissatisfaction with the programmes.
In an effort to save money, the governor of Sao Paulo, Oakham, plans to close 100 public schools, and 300,000 students will be transferred to school.
Some of the students who took part in the protest expressed their displeasure with interim President Michel Temer through graffiti on the wall.
Just days before a recent protest, protesters collectively took to the streets in support of President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the state Senate.
Scottish cyclist Callum Skinner celebrates after winning cycling gold
Scottish cyclist Callum Skinner competed in the men's group race in Rio last night to help the British trio successfully defend their Olympic gold medals after the London 2012 Olympic Games.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist replaced his Scottish compatriot, Sir Chris Hoy, as the backbone of the team, and even the legendary cyclist was proud of him when the young Skinner beat the title-winning New Zealand team with a reputation.
Four years ago, the British team was stunning, and Hoy captured the fifth of the individual's six Olympic gold medals.
The British team finished sixth at the World Cycling Championships in London in March, and Hoy has since retired.
During the Beijing Olympic Games in London, the problem for the British team was to replace the "first circle of experts" Jamie Falstaff.
That's exactly what the team did when Sides appeared.
Hoey's retirement also left a void, and both Chien-Mayi and Matt Cranton wanted to fill the void.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the British men's coaching staff insisted that he be selected for the national team, and Skinner ultimately did not.
Skinner's partner, Sims and Kenny, who won gold with Hoy four years ago, refreshed their Olympic record in the qualifying round, but this was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the three British cyclists finally beat their rivals to win the gold medal.
While Sims was slightly behind, Kenny took the lead for the team, and Skinner kept that lead to the end.
The change in strategy was the key to this reversal, with Sides opting for a larger flywheel, and therefore slower, which allowed Kenny, especially Skinner, to keep pace.
Howie looked on as a BBC commentator, and Skinner, Kenny and Sims saw him as they made their way to the podium.
"It flattered me," said 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist Callum Skinner.
I just did what I could to make a name for myself.
We set the Olympic record in the final and beat the world champion.
This is unbelievable.
There's nothing better than this win.
After winning gold medals with Kenny and Hoy at the 2012 London Olympics, Sides admitted to deliberately falling on the track after a poor start.
He later withdrew the comment, and the British team's opponents were unable to appeal.
And this victory does not have any such problems.
"It's like being in London with a British flag on the platform," Mr Hinds said.
We were in the team just three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world champions, so it's amazing to be able to defend the Olympic title.
It was just a match, a gold medal for the British team that won seven of the 10 Olympic cycling gold medals at the Beijing Olympics and the London Olympics.
If this is emblematic of the progress we have made over the past five months, we will continue to be successful at the bike house over the next five days.
According to Kenny's state, it is not impossible for him to recreate Hoy's feat of winning three gold medals at a single Olympics.
If that's the case, Behoy is 12 years younger and equally on March 23 (which seems to be a holy day for the British sports world, with Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister also born on this day) Kenny will have six golds and one silver.
The score was flat with Hoy.
Kenny will next play in the three-day race, which starts today.
"I'll be focusing on the game for the time being," the 28-year-old Bolton man said.
Team games are always the best.
You can win games with teammates.
Frankly, one win is a little lonely.
"If he can win another two gold medals, then he should be awarded a knighthood," Mr Hindes said.
It was the only match of the day to produce a medal, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Duel advanced to the four-kilometre group chase with the fastest score.
Their score was 351.943.
And the world record for the 2012 London Olympic gold medallist was 351.659.
The first round and the final (10: 42 p.m.) will be held on the second race day today, and Wiggins will no doubt be in the spotlight.
Yesterday he had an argument with match officials before qualifying, when match officials asked him to measure height.
In the women's race, which will end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rotherell Shande, Elinor Barker and Kate Archibald, from Milehead, advanced with a new world record of 413.260.
In the middle of the Games, the British team took the initiative and won many medals in the middle of the Games.
After showing their absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British self-propelled team made a slight disappointment in their journey to Rio.
There have been many twists and turns, including April technical director Sean Sutton's resignation over allegations of sexism and bullying and the retirement of legends such as Hoey, Victoria Pendleton.
But the bike hall's first game of the night is enough to prove that the British team will play again at a critical time to reach the peak of the saga.
After a little life comes to this world, parents are responsible for this life, not only in the physical health of the child, but also in the development of the spirit, that is, education.
If there is a failure in the education of the child, then even if the cause is successful, it will not compensate for the lack of life, the failure of the family.
When a new life comes, the new dad will have to take the time to look after and educate the children and take responsibility for him.
And responsible, in addition to the body care, let them health, also in the spirit of education, that is to let the child learn how to be a man, how adult, how successful.
Good family education means that parents often need to accompany their children, to care for their children, to be patient, and to teach their children how to behave in a civilized manner so that they can learn knowledge and improve their intelligence.
The parents' actions will affect the growth of the child, and they will imitate their parents, which is often said to be the dragon, the phoenix, the mouse, the child will make a hole, the parents what kind of child.
So parents need to be a good example in front of their children, regulate their own words and deeds, and cultivate their own good character, which can indirectly help the child to shape a good heart and make him better.
Amy is a smart and beautiful girl.
She is outgoing and lively, can get along well with her friends, and has a good adaptability to the environment.
But Amy had a little secret: She couldn't keep her focus on what she was trying to do.
This secret has been with Amy for a long time. The problem is not serious.
Even through decentralized, modular time to study and work, she is essentially able to accomplish tasks and achieve good results.
But when the task was heavy and time was tight, Amy felt very distressed and tortured.
The aim of the individual's resistance to self-exposure and emotional experience is not to threaten the self-awareness and self-esteem of the individual.
There are also behavioral psychologists who understand the impedance as an individual's disobedience to their behavior.
I tried to get Amy to do an exercise that would allow her to calm down by breathing and to feel the pain.
And once she left the trapped situation, she felt relaxed and regained her freedom.
A 63-year-old homeless man had an argument with another hobo, Shaw, and stabbed him to death with a knife.
Han said he and a homeless man lived on the ground in an alley in the eastern part of the city. They were more than 20 meters apart.
Han said that on the day of the case, they were called by their friends to drink together, and the two were in a dispute with each other both at dinner and after dinner.
Han said he was afraid that Xiao had hit him, and he picked up a fruit knife from the dump and stabbed him to death.
In court, the victims' families asked Han for compensation for funeral expenses and death compensation totalling more than 53, 000 yuan.
Uber's entry into the Taiwan market for four years has had a significant impact on the local traditional taxi industry.
Taiwan's Yonhap reported on August 12 that more than a hundred taxis went around Taiwan's "Executive House" in protest, causing severe traffic paralysis in the surrounding area.
The director of the Taipei City Drivers' Union, Zheng Li-chia, said Uber had come to the table for four years before the authorities met at the end of the month, and the drivers could no longer wait.
The government, however, did not believe it, and it dragged on.
Law-abiding taxi drivers, who belong to the bottom line of labor, want to compete with the illegal but unrestricted Uber and feel cheated by the authorities.

After the sentence came into effect, because Li did not automatically fulfill the obligations determined by the judgment, Wang made an application to Shuyang Court for enforcement.
On 16 October 2014, the Shuyang Court issued a civil decision, ruling that the eggs of the eggs in all the farms of Li had been impounded in 2000, and that they could not be transferred or sold without permission.
After receiving the seizure decision, Li privately sold some of the eggs that had been seized in the farm without the permission of Shuyang Court.

The head of the Industry Coordination Division of the National Development and Reform Commission said today that steel overcapacity is a global problem.
In recent years, the capacity utilization rate of our country is higher than the global average, and also higher than that of countries and regions such as the US and Europe.
Our country has taken firm and effective measures to resolve the excess capacity, and the results are gradually becoming apparent.
The chief pointed out that the central government of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to the global problem of excess steel capacity.
All departments and regions actively implement the deployment of the State Council and work in earnest to reduce the capacity of crude steel by about 45 million tons this year.
On the basis of our national conditions, we do not encourage the export of steel. On the contrary, we have adopted a series of practical measures to control the export of steel.
The person in charge emphasized that international trade in steel products is essentially market behavior. It is an autonomous choice based on the demand of the importing country and consumers' consideration of the value of the product.
The implementation of trade protection measures does not contribute to a fundamental solution to the development of the global steel industry; on the contrary, it will only cause further shocks to the international trade order.
When it comes to debt, the chief stressed that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly addressed in the process of eliminating excess capacity.
Because of the size and breadth of the assets of iron and steel enterprises, the debt relationships of some enterprises are complex, and if they are not properly disposed of, they may lead to regional risks.
According to the person in charge, in recent years, with the downward pressure on the economy and the gradual weakening of society's aggregate demand, there has been a decline in capacity utilization in some industries and increasing difficulties in the production and operation of enterprises.
Some enterprises do not adapt to the changes of the market environment, the production and operation is not sustainable or even close to collapse, but they are constrained by some institutional factors and become "zombie enterprises."
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces the efficiency of the use of factor resources, increases the cost of social management and hinders the establishment of a level playing field.
The main reasons for the losses are the same as those facing the global steel industry - weak market demand and low capacity utilization.
Our country mainly adopts the market mechanism, the economic means and the rule of law method, the government is mainly to do a good job at the bottom of the staff and social stability, to ensure a fair and fair market order.
The person in charge stressed that the next step is to remain committed to capacity work and to ensure that the target of 100 million to 150 million tons of crude steel capacity is completed in five years.
As soon as the Chinese tourist police made their debut in Red Square in Moscow on Friday afternoon, Chinese tourists waved with surprise, and locals and foreign tourists couldn't help but look back.
On the same day, members of the tourist police detachment of China's first professional tourist police, Sanaya City, Hainan Province, came to Moscow Red Square to study with the local tourist police.
Moscow tourist police officers patrol the Red Square, Nico Liesky Walk, Guim department store, etc., and the Chinese tourist police study with the guard, and the whole process lasts for over an hour.
A female police officer in her 20s this year and fluent in English and Spanish, she joined the tourist police force last year.
He carefully observed the actions of his Russian counterparts along the way, and interacted with her from time to time.
When the Spanish tourists came to consult, the Moscow tourist police spoke patiently in fluent Spanish, which impressed Wang Bing.
"Every person in the Moscow tourist police has a foreign language, and there are more than two, which is very important for us," he said.
"Hainan, as an international tourist island, is gradually focusing on attracting international visitors, and we want to improve our ability to match the status of the international tourist island."
Before studying with the guard on the same day, the Chinese tourist police also went to the Moscow city tourist police brigade site to communicate with their Russian counterparts.
"I often deal with Chinese tourists, and I'm very happy to see them traveling to Russia," he said.
"The question they usually ask for help is how the road goes, where a certain monument is, how to make a rental, how to get back to the hotel."
Moscow's urban environment and tourism climate have become better in recent years and are becoming increasingly attractive to foreign tourists, said Ray Isakov, chief of the Moscow Tourism Police Brigade.
To meet the needs of tourism development, a tourist police force was established in July 2014 to patrol the main attractions and to assist and channel tourists.
At present, all Moscow tourist police are fluent in English and partly in Spanish and German.
The police brigade divided them into nine groups according to the level of foreign language, two sessions a week, learning self-defence, laws and regulations and foreign languages.
"At the moment, two tourist police officers are starting to learn Chinese, which has been said to be good, and we will continue to improve their Chinese level," he said.
He told reporters that the Moscow tourist police have accumulated some experience since they were formed, hoping to inspire their counterparts in Sanya.
In his view, the cooperation between the police departments of Russia and China will enhance the sense of security for their citizens to travel to the other country.
"There is a lot of inspiration for the staff of the Moscow tourist police, the policing model, the equipment, and the good interaction with the tourists," said Chen.
At least nine provinces, including Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian and Beijing, have issued rules for the implementation of residence permits.
With regard to the conditions for obtaining a residence permit, the above-mentioned areas are generally proposed to reside for more than six months, in accordance with one of the conditions for lawful and stable employment, legal stability of residence and continuous attendance.
It noted that, in terms of the treatment provided by the residence permit, the "gold content" varies from place to place, and the scope of public services and facilities provided in some areas has been expanded in comparison with the national version.
These areas have increased the ease with which children can participate in the local college entrance examination, subject to the relevant conditions.
In addition, Beijing, among others, has explicitly requested that the provision of public services and facilities be progressively expanded and made publicly available to society on a regular basis.
For example, Fujian proposes to publish to the society at least once every three years the scope of public services and facilities enjoyed by the holder of a residence permit.
In accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Residence Permit, the public security organ shall, within 15 days from the date of receiving the residence permit, issue a residence permit within 15 days from the date of admissibility.
For the time limit, most areas agree with the national version, that is, within 15 days.
Hebei has made it clear that it shall issue residence permits within 3 working days from the date of receiving the public security police station, which meets the requirements of the application and the material is complete.
The public security organ shall make the issuance of a residence permit within 5 working days from the date of admissibility.
In accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on residence permits, the above-mentioned areas are clear, for the first time, to apply for a residence permit and to waive the fee for documentation.
For example, Sichuan requires that local public police stations or commissioned community service agencies strictly enforce the approved charging items and fee rates, and firmly prohibit overreach, ultra-standard charges or ride-sharing fees.
On July 27, 2016, on July 27, 2016, Chen Yangxia, former secretary of the County Commission of Ganzhou City, went to work as director of the party's wind and wind watchdog (deputy director level, one year of probation).
The red wine that was consumed that night was provided personally by Li friends, and the other costs were borne by Mr. Liu.
The Jiangxi Provincial Commission reported that Chen Yangxia, Cheng Zi Liang and others in private meetings organized and accepted to eat, in violation of the central eight rules of the spirit, violated party discipline.
Bogba had two yellow cards in the Coppa Italia last season and will be given an automatic ban under the rules.
Although he has moved back to the Premier League, the FA has extended its cumulative ban to the Premier League.
As a result, in an away game against Bournemouth on 14 August, Bogba will play the wallabies and his return to Manchester United will be extended to a 20-day home game with Southampton.
As a first-round No.12 in 2014, Surrey will make an official landing in the NBA next season, as well as the Cardiff City 76ers.
As a young European player, many fans didn't know much about him, but through the Games, he was impressed by his performance.
In the last game of Croatia's win over Spain, Surrey managed to seal off Paul Gasol's attempt to drag the game into a bonus-point basket in the final moments.
In recent days, 76ers coach Brett Brown has given Surrey a high rating, and the Spurs manager believes he saw the shadow of Manu Ginobili at a young age in Surrey.
It was clear that Surrey had shown his talent and made the 76ers look forward to him.
In Croatia's first two games at the Olympics, Surrey had 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.
In the first half, Surrey showed his ability to pull out of space on the field, and he was able to hit shots outside the three-point line after blocking with a teammate.
While the 76ers are currently hoarding a lot of talented young players, they don't have an outside linebacker.
From caps to start-ups and finishing assists, there are a handful of players who can do that in today's NBA games.
Since the start of the Olympics, Surrey has scored 13 points, eight rebounds and five assists in three games.
Since deciding to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014, James has signed two 1 + 1 contracts in a row.
As the NBA's current collective agreement enters its final year, as vice president of the NBA players' union, James will be at the forefront of collective bargaining.
Given the big boost in the league's revenue, thanks to a new televised deal and a feud between bosses and players over how to handle the money, there are fears the NBA will fall into lockdown next summer.
But for James, he won't have to worry about becoming a free agent next summer because he has signed a three-year contract with the Cavaliers.
Regardless of when the 2017-18 season officially begins, James is under contract.
Since the surprise appearance of the iPhone SE, the mobile phone market has also ushered in a boom in the small screen.
Not long ago, Nubian also launched the first piece of its Z11 series: NubiaZ11mini.
Nubia Z11mini continues its consistently brilliant photo-taking gene, and is equipped with a more accessible 5.0-inch screen, easy-to-use rear fingerprint recognition, and an excellent use experience.
Nubia's just-listed small-screen camera phone, Z11mini, has cut its price by 200 yuan, from $1499 to $1299.
In terms of appearance, nubiaZ11mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen with a classic "Little Red Circle" design on the front.
The medium frame is made of metal, with a symmetrical design at the bottom and a Type-C data interface.
Portland smelter's future fraught with uncertainty over power supply contract cancellations
The Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria and hundreds of workers at the plant are now facing an uncertain future, as the power company supplying the plant revealed that a factory owner would terminate a supply contract that would invalidate all supply contracts.
The move comes after the Victorian government decided not to continue issuing subsidies to guarantee plant operations.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will be terminated in November.
2000 workers at the company's Portland plant could face job losses.
Once the plant closes, there may be as many as 2,000 people directly or indirectly unemployed.
And because the plant accounts for about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity output, there may be a knock-on effect.
In 2014, the US-aluminium company shut down the Hanley Point smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesey power plant last year.
The Portland smelter is currently at a loss and is at risk of closure.
The move comes after a forecast of the plant's future years, initially due to a stronger Australian dollar, and more recently because of the price of factory products.
AGL, which provides electricity to the large aluminium smelter through the old Eyang power plant in the LaTrobe Valley, predicts that three other plant owners will also terminate their agreements.
The factory's largest shareholder is a joint venture between an aluminum company and an alumina company, while China's Zhongxin Group and Japan's Pill Red Co also hold a small stake.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, meaning the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand," the joint venture said.
AGL said the contracts were "hedging contracts" that should have been in effect since November 2016.
The contract is terminated for a period of 12 months, so they will be terminated in 2017.
"As a result, AGL continues to predict that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in the 2017 fiscal year," the power company said.
Any potential revenue impact on AGL from fiscal year 2018 is currently subject to an optimistic outlook in the futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said the company had written down its contract value of $187 million in "termination activity expectations."
The company said the decision to terminate the contracts "would not affect the ability of the company to operate the smelter or to guarantee the power supply to the smelter."
The American company said it signed a 20-year contract with Lao Yang in 2010, which would have come into effect in November this year, but the company did not explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle will be closed because of the industry's poor economic situation.
In response to comments made by analysts earlier this week, AGL operations director Stephen Mickelson said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity per year, and the Tomago plant reaches about 900 megawatts.
If the two factories are closed, the demand for the electricity market will be greatly reduced.
"As a power company, this is not good news for us," he said.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups are turned away from community legal centres each year, and the funding of the service is already stretched and now faces further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three out of every five people are denied access to free legal advice and agency services, most of whom are elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the resources to fight unjust evictions.
The lack of funding for community legal services has long exceeded the limit and now faces further funding cuts.
Since June next year, federal funding for these legal centres will be reduced by another 30 per cent.
Queensland Community Law Centre director James Farrell said thousands of people were turned away each year, according to the latest National Community Association Law Centre investigation report.
Mr Farrell said the situation would only get worse if the federal government did not change existing decisions.
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically under-funded, which means that thousands of people will not be able to access the vital services they need," he said.
People who need to stay away from violence, people with huge debts that cannot be repaid, families facing disintegration, squeezed workers, all face legal problems, and the report shows that they can't get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by another 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable groups in Queensland will be forced to take on complex legal issues without help.
We call on Justice Minister and Queensland MP George Brandis to immediately undo these funding cuts so people can get the help they need in the face of legal problems.
Last year, the state government pledged to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
Attention must now be paid to the needs of community legal centres and their corresponding communities, and the Government must also invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign team sued over staff pulling guns
New York: Trump's campaign team has been indicted for inaction after pulling a gun on a staff member while driving a Jeep in February.
Vincent Bodini, a former software trainer for the state's campaign team, described the incident Wednesday in state court in Charlotte.
Mr Bodini said he had hoped the matter would be resolved internally, but after a few months of waiting, he realized "this is not going to happen."
According to Bodini's description, the director, Earl Philip, "pulled out a handgun, put his right index finger on the board and pointed the gun at Vincent's knee."
After complaining to local and regional campaign team leadership, Bodini learned from the file that at least four other people had experienced the same thing.
"No shooting does not mean no harm will be done," Bodini said in the complaint.
Just two days before the case, the Republican presidential candidate told the crowd in North Carolina that if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, was elected and picked her favorite judge, then "the people who support the Second Amendment," that is, gun holders and gun enthusiasts might act, the statement sparked outrage.
Trump's campaign team said the media had broken his words and that he did not promote violence.
In his complaint, Bodini asked the campaign team to pay compensation for his own lax oversight, while also asking Philip for compensation for his own attacks, beatings and mental injuries.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the news.
Philip could not be reached.
Philip left the campaign team in the near term, according to WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotte.
His consulting firm, Innovation Consulting Services, did not immediately respond to the call.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign team has been dogged by controversy.
The two sides in the case are Bodini and Trump's presidential campaign company, 16-CS-14300, the General Chamber of the High Court in Mecklenburg County (Charlotte).
Britain must deliver Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring energy and prosperity to our community, London and the country as a whole.
For me, this is the charm of Heathrow, just as at the 2012 London Olympics we did everything we could to ensure that our country and region could benefit from these events.
The Olympics have benefited Stratford and the East.
And we will again benefit the region by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local community alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and allow young people around the airport to get out of unemployment.
As in the run-up to the London Olympics in 2012, some thought Heathrow's expansion was too big.
I have been told that Britain will not be able to prepare for the Olympics and that we will be disgraced in front of the world.
The challengers are wrong about the 2012 Olympics, and their doubts about the Heathrow project will also prove to be wrong.
While there will always be obstacles to overcome, Heathrow is addressing every problem it faces.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for most people, not a few.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs and generate £211bn of economic growth, leaving a wealth of technology and jobs around the airport and across the UK.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team that is on time and has completed a £11 billion infrastructure investment project within the budget, including the T5 terminal, which has been elected to the world's best airport terminal for five consecutive years, and the T2 terminal between the world's busiest two runways.
Now they are ready to build a third runway with £16bn of private investment.
The UK has successfully hosted the 2012 London Olympics, and I believe the Heathrow expansion project will also be a huge success.
It is a good time for us to deliver the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, so that we can protect our future and create a wealth of technology and employment that will make Britain proud.
Lord Paul Dalton is chairman of the board of directors at Heathrow and a former UK Treasury business counsellor
A woman committed suicide and was run over on a Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
The woman, who tried to kill himself, was run over by multiple cars on the highway early Thursday morning, and police are now looking for witnesses.
The accident happened on the A1 motorway near Fort Worth, Va., in the early hours of Thursday morning.
A woman was "desperate" to lie on the road late at night and was run over by multiple cars, Vaud police said.
The victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman with apparent suicidal intent, was run over by multiple vehicles, including a van.
The woman died at the scene.
Police have revealed that a number of drivers have been investigated, but part of the driver has yet to be identified. Police are now calling on them, as well as witnesses to the accident, to come forward for investigation.
Lawyers for Gilles Hofstein told the Geneva Tribune that a criminal investigation has now been launched, which is a routine process for such incidents.
But it is not yet known whether drivers will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid a collision?
"This will be determined by the prosecutor," Mr Hofstein said.
Based on the results of two other similar cases in the past five years, drivers will not be held accountable.
According to the newspaper, both cases were caused by people taking to the highway late at night, and the final verdict was that the driver could not have expected a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was charged with negligence in the death of a man accused in August 2014 of hitting a man and causing her death on the A1 motorway near Pareena.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim crossed the road after drinking alcohol.
After an investigation, the judge said the policewoman's driving was completely legal at the time and that the man appeared on the road "completely unexpected and unpredictable," and that the policewoman made an emergency call afterwards.
Anyone who can provide information about the accident near Morne on Thursday should contact police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once fit for human habitation
According to projections from NASA's new climate model, Venus was once suitable for human habitation.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Research have developed a model that can explore the past of Venus, which uses tools and algorithms that are very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether Venus, which has a high temperature, no water, and an atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, once had an Earth-like environment.
Previously, scientists thought that Venus's rotation was slower because of its thicker atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thinner, Earth-like atmosphere and had a slower rotation rate at that time.
The model also shows the early terrain of Venus.
Venus may have more dry areas than Earth, but there have been enough water and geographic changes to breed life and prevent rapid evaporation.
In the early days, the sunlight on Venus was 30% brighter than the Earth.
"In the model simulation at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the slow rotation of Venus has kept the daylight hours on its side for nearly two months," Goddard Institute for Space Research scientist Anthony Del Gianio explained in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that can form thick clouds, and thick clouds, like an umbrella, block most of the sun's heat.
The result of the simulation is that the average climate temperature of Venus is actually a few degrees lower than it is now.
The evolution of Venus simulated by the model is similar to that of previous planetary scientists.
Although there may have been life on Venus, in the course of billions of years, Venus was exposed to high temperatures and ultraviolet rays.
The ocean on the planet evaporates, and the water vapor is consumed by ultraviolet light.
With the escape of hydrogen, there is only a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse gas effect, creating the Venus that we know today.
Researchers published the results of a simulation of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy to step down as avalanche team manager
Patrick Rowe, who stepped down as head coach and vice president of the Colorado avalanche ice team on Thursday, said he had no say in the team's decision-making level.
Colorado executive vice president Joe Saracens confirmed the news and said the club would immediately start looking for a new head coach.
"Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice-president of the Colorado avalanche team with vigour, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I've been thinking hard over the summer about how to improve this team and bring it to the next level.
To that end, the goal of the head coach and vice president needs to be consistent with the club's goals.
He also needs to have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
For the time being, however, these conditions have not been met.
Saracens, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Mr Saracens said.
We thank him for his contribution to the club and wish him every success in the future.
Rowe was nominated for the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach in his first season of coaching the avalanche team in 2013-14.
He helped the club get 112 points in the first half, but Colorado was eliminated by the Minnesota team in the first round of the playoffs and lost the playoffs in the last two years.
In the 2015-16 season, the avalanche team finished with 39 wins and 39 turnovers, and ended up losing a second out-of-the-card qualification to the Western Bulldogs by five points.
As a Hall of Fame goalie, Roy has won four Stanley Cups and won two each while playing for the Montreal Canadians and the avalanche team.
North Sea oil field workers halt strike, continue talks
The chief negotiator said workers in the North Sea oil field had halted a strike on pay, and the parties to the dispute began a new round of negotiations.
There have been multiple strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group on the North Sea oil platform run by Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement, "Wood Group and Unite and the RMT union can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of resolving the current dispute."
We will have a number of full-day meetings to revisit these issues in the coming weeks, starting early next week.
The union said its recent action was to protest the highest possible pay cut of 30 per cent, the first time the union has taken this action in 25 years.
Wood Group has reduced compensation for North Sea contractors by about 9 per cent this year due to market pressures.
Before the pay cut, the company reduced compensation for offshore contractors by 10 per cent in 2014.
The company said another pay cut would help the company survive the market slump.
Shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries because of the company's need to streamline its operations following its merger with British energy company British Gas.
Energy companies are under pressure from falling crude oil prices and the UK's June Brexit decision.
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to explore the biggest labour dispute of this generation in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea was crucial for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea and the country as a whole, we need an economy that serves the majority rather than the minority," Dave said in the statement.
In 2016, spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected to be no more than $1.4 billion, compared with an average project expenditure of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of the stars of the Stardust cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete rotation of the stars of the Stardust star.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why the star's stars have different rotation rates and the association of rotation cycles with the planet's composition.
"We hope to further understand the relationship between stellar quality, age, and even the history of our solar system by comparing our results with those of other stars," Luisa Rebel, a research scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing Analysis at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said in a news release.
The star cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and have just reached adulthood.
They achieve the highest rotation speed of a lifetime.
At the highest rotation speed, these mature stars shoot out a lot of stellar winds.
When these stellar winds pass through the star's magnetic field, they can have a braking effect on the star.
As the stars age, their rotation rates start to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the time in which recognizable stars, like sunspots, appear.
The latest rotation speed data sets show that larger stars have a slower rotation than smaller-quality stars.
Rebel likens the star to a dancer, and the larger dancer spins slower than the smaller dancer.
"We found that stars with slower rotation tend to be of a larger mass, and that the fastest-rotating stars tend to be the lightest stars," Mr Reible said.
Because of its close proximity, it can be used as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare the mass and rotation speed of stars.
"It lays the groundwork for a theoretical model of the two-way rotation of young and elderly stars," he said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why stars slow their rotation and "pack up their dancing shoes."
In three new papers, Mr. Rebel and her colleagues elaborated on their latest analysis of the rotation speed of the star cluster, which will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
Zheng Jianjun, Chief of the Water Management Section of the South Lake Park, said that the depths of the South Lake, which is more than 10 metres deep, do not understand the situation and are likely to be in danger.
"Although the South Lake rescue team is very professional, it is hoped that a wide range of rowing visitors will be able to wear a life jacket, do not do any irregularities on the lake, and play safely," said Zheng Jianjun.
The village has a unique marine environment, sitting on the natural and human ecology of the two main leisure tourism resources.
"But the individual owners who have purchased the parking spaces, afraid that this will affect their parking prices, and suspect that others have a private heart, have been left behind, leading to the suspension of parking."
There is still a lot of confusion about when the sweet potato will be introduced by anyone.
In the current mainstream view, there are three main routes for the introduction of sweet potatoes.
The most influential and most widespread of the three routes introduced by the sweet potato is that Chen Zhenlong was introduced into Fuzhou by the Philippines.
The Beijing Social Group Management Office will now carry out a special inspection on the use of the uniform receipts for social groups.
The inspection is divided into the unit self-examination and the focus spot check.
According to the relevant head of the municipal association, the scope of the inspection covers the social groups that have received a unified receipt of contributions from social groups in the municipal associations for the period 2013-2015.
"The success of the Olympic Games is defined by the people who share stories on social media," Rio organizers said in the 2002 Olympic communications strategy.
From the report of the Olympic Games, the media in the mode of transmission, product form, language style, news perspective and so on have made great changes in the past.
The IOC and media practitioners from all over the world seem to have to meet this challenge.
On 11 August, it was announced that the market reaction was flat in the first two days. According to the plan, it will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 18 August.
According to an analyst at a domestic brokerage, Eastern Securities is not a good base in Hong Kong. It is the managing director. It appears to be inadequate compared to China, China and China Securities.
Experts point out that this year as the stock market returns to the insipid, many brokerages have experienced a decline, but after the company goes public, the situation should be more to see the development of the company's own business, can not generalize.
After the introduction of the New Deal, Suzhou will become the first country in the country to restart the limited purchase of second-line cities.
The second-line cities that have introduced or are about to introduce regulatory policies in the housing market are not only Suzhou, but also Hefei, Nanjing and other cities.
Previously, Hefei has taken the lead in issuing a limited-credit policy, and the bank will refuse to offer mortgage services to home buyers with two suites in Hefei and an outstanding set of home loans.
