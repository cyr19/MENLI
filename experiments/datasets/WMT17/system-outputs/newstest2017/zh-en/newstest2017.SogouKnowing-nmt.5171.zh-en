The 28-year-old cook was found dead in a San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old Cook, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a stairwell in a local shopping mall this week.
But the victim's brother said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to harm him and said, "everything is better at last."
The San Francisco coroner's Office said the body found at the Westfield shopping center Wednesday morning was confirmed to be the 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled to have killed him and was under investigation.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC Radio in San Francisco that Frank, who had been a line cook in Boston, found an ideal job for a pipeline chef six months ago in the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said they were "very shocked" by Frank's death.
"We are a small team of people who get along like a close family and we will miss him deeply, "the spokesman said.
We express our deepest sympathy and condolences to Frank's family and friends at this sad time.
The Louis Galicia said Frank initially lived in a guest house, but recently "everything is good at last."
Louis Galicia told KGO: "Frank found an apartment and was dating a girl."
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to harm his brother.
Frank has a good heart and a broad mind.
"Frank often cooks dinner for his family," he said.
He was never willing to quarrel with his family.
He is a person who follows the opinions of everyone.
"All things in the world are likely to go wrong, but Frank is a rough diamond that shines every day, "Louis Galicia said.
People who have a clue please call the San Francisco police station to report the phone 415-575-4444.
Junior doctors strike: Call for new labour action
The junior doctor's representative called on the Union to approve its new labour action against the new contract dispute.
The Junior Doctors Committee of the British Medical Association will ask all its members to start supporting more labour action in early September.
The junior doctors' Committee said the Ministers had failed to address concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted to boycott a contract deal with the British Medical Association in July.
Of the members who participated in the voting, 58% objected to the contract deal.
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the Chairman of the junior medical Committee, Ellen McCourt, said the government had "always been silent" on issues that led to a boycott of the contract.
"In view of this, the Executive Committee of the Junior Doctors Committee has voted to reject the proposed new contract and call for formal consultations on all concerns, "she said.
In response to the government's silence, the Executive Committee of the junior Medical Council has today formally requested the Council of the British Medical Association to convene a special session to approve a long-term plan to upgrade the labour operation from the beginning of September.
The dispute has led to the participation of junior doctors in six strikes this year, including the first full-scale strike in the history of the NHS.
Dr Johann Malawana, a junior doctor at the British Medical Association, resigned after a vote boycott of the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the British Medical Association.
In a meeting prior to the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students, he told members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should therefore be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be enforced in England's medical staff.
Russia and Turkey: "Do not belong to the alliance"?
A gesture put an end to a crisis.
The Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday, shaking hands and announcing a formal end to eight months of war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin met the Turkish President in the resplendent hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I had a strong feeling that this reconciliation was what Ankara would like to see.
Yes, the two sides did shake hands.
However, even in the light of Mr Putin's always reserved criteria, Putin is only smiling, with little enthusiasm.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan is reported to have made five references to "good friends" Vladimir Putin.
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia would return to the pre-crisis level, even to a higher level.
The next day, a newspaper here wrote that Mr Erdogan had acted as if nothing had happened.
But I think his enthusiasm hints at something in the opposite direction.
Mr Putin's continued indifference, however, shows that he has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction was fierce at the time.
Mr Putin lashed out at the incident, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow behind his back.
Attacks from so-called friends are more difficult to accept.
It is difficult or even impossible to re-establish genuine trust between the two sides.
Russian public opinion has also been reversed since November.
For months, the government-controlled media have carried out an alarming all-out offensive against Ankara.
All of a sudden, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
Among them, the most serious is the criticism from senior officials that Mr Erdogan's family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in the Syrian region controlled by the Islamic State.
He has categorically denied the claim.
However, the news from St. Petersburg showed that it was time to look forward.
After all, the meeting is premised on the fact that Putin has received an apology from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the truce are obvious.
First, Erdogan has nearly been ousted after a failed coup last month, so he needs the support of all his friends.
It is clear that the ongoing terrorist attacks have been a great blow to him.
At the same time there are economic motives.
Russian sanctions have been a great blow to Turkey, in particular the ban on charter services that can deliver millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The figure has fallen sharply near 90%.
With the resumption of flights, Russia's travel agencies and charter companies are bound to breathe a sigh of relief.
They will usher in the end-of-season Mediterranean tourism boom.
State television has even predicted this week that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall once Turkish agricultural imports are reopened.
"The tourists are gone and the tomatoes are coming back, "said a report from the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti.
For Moscow, the visit also has additional political value.
Ankara is angry at the weak response of the western world to the intentions of the takeover.
In addition, Ankara has long been dissatisfied with the slow progress in EU negotiations and Putin 's involvement, and Putin is keen to take advantage of the political chill and weaken Turkey 's relations with the Western world.
As a result of the pro-election authorities following the failure of the coup, Russia's leaders will be given Ankara's bonus points.
Note that this is a gift for Moscow, which has always had a deep-rooted fear of regime change.
As a result, a meeting in this magnificent seaside palace has led Russia and Turkey to form allies in a country that has been rejected and abused by the Western world, and an analyst described it as "an alien alliance."
However, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two sides.
Syria is one of the key factors, and Moscow has recently played the role of peacemaker in Syria, while Russia and Turkey have supported the opposing factions.
Predictably, after nearly three hours of preliminary talks, the two presidents said at a press conference that they had not yet talked about the subject.
The Turkish President has deliberately avoided questions about the differences between the two sides, while Putin has emphasized it.
The two sides did not reach a clear consensus on how to seek common ground on the Syrian issue.
The resumption of dialogue between the leaders of the two countries will certainly be a good thing, given the months of public hostility and the possibility of a major catastrophe caused by the shooting down of Russian jets in Turkey 's member States of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland
According to the chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank will be simplified into a Logistics Department.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland division that the Royal Bank of Scotland has been committed to its global ambitions.
But eight years ago, when it was on the verge of collapse, it had to accept that it had abandoned that pursuit since then.
During that time, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
The group used millions of pounds to sponsor international sporting events in the form of sponsorship of the rugby six-nation competition and the Wimbledon tennis tournament champion Andy Murray.
But right now, the right thing to do is to make more national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not return to its original form.
In England and Wales, all references outside the headquarters and stock exchanges will be changed to the national Westminster bank.
The Ulster Bank brand has been used for clients of the Republic of Ireland and the Northern Ireland autonomous region.
There are other, more prominent, smaller private banking brands, such as Gu capital bank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan has been interviewed during a tour of the client and employee of Inverness County.
"The Royal Bank of Scotland will eventually become our brand of investors and one of our employees, because at the moment we have become a bank with many brands, "he told BBC Scotland.
As the bank itself becomes an international brand, RBS has also become a global brand.
At present, I would like to say that we are no longer focused on the global, we have turned our eyes to the home.
Each brand represents the difference between their respective industries, and our employees are serving customers through different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has shown that it will not continue to sponsor the six-nation tournament; at the same time, efforts have been made to improve the image of different brands in sports sponsorship.
"It's time to become a multi-brand bank, because in private we have been exploring how to become a better service to our customers, "the chief executive said.
If we aspire to be a big bank with a large number of brands three years ago, it will be a mockery.
At present, we focus on customer needs, and I am sure you have taken note of these changes.
I think we can reboot these brands, and the time is right now.
Dai Tuli won a career 3,000 victory with Predilection's success in Newmarket
Newmarket's two victories helped Dai Tuli get a career 3,000 win, after which he sprayed champagne to celebrate
On Friday, the professional jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000 victory in Newmarket.
The Predilection, who was driven by the hand of the trainer John Gosden, sped up the drive and won two victories that night, as well as a career 3,000 victory.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional jockey who has made this milestone in the field of Flat racing.
The top five are: Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
"This is very special, "said Dai Tuli, a three-time champion jockey at Ghayyar.
I'm very excited, because my family is on the scene too
I'm happy with what I've achieved in Newmarket, because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a large-scale Jockey Club, or Royal Ascot, it's just a normal Friday night with an audience of 20,000.
I am very pleased and very humble.
Dai Tuli brought the Predilection after the victory, causing the crowd to cheer
In the area of hurdle race, two jockeys have made this achievement. They are the champion jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20th champion, Sir Anthony McCoy, in which Sir Mccoy won more than a 4,300 victory in his record-breaking career.
Berg is the ninth Derby champion and has won a total of 4,493 victories in his career
Dai Tuli is one of the best jockeys in the world, so it is not surprising that he has achieved this landmark achievement, and there are few people who have achieved it before.
He is stylish and robust, but what really makes him stand out in the weighing room is his tactical rationality.
He is an amazing equestrian Ambassador, and over the years his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted a lot of fans for the sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Dai Tuli in Epsom that if he wasn't just a weekend jockey, he should have been able to win the 6,000 game!
Indeed, it is very important that Dai Tuli is the best equestrian winner in the UK for 30 years.
He was lively, and it was a good thing for the British horse racing, but in addition, he was an incredible jockey.
Dai Tuli celebrates this milestone with its iconic jump off the horse
From the jump line to the jump, Dai Tuli has been a typical representative of the British Flat racing field for twenty years.
His career is like a roller coaster.
He won a number of tournaments, including the famous "seven wins" in Royal Ascot in 1996, but he also suffered a crash and was suspended for doping.
Three years ago, when he returned to the field at the end of the six-month period, he was struggling, but he showed an amazing personality advantage and finally returned to the top and gave a slap in the face to those who were sceptical.
He may not have been able to do it for a long time - he had said before that he hoped to be at least 50 years old.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is relieved of the post of Director of the Executive Office of Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly lifted the director of the Office of the President of Sergei Ivanov.
For years, Mr Ivanov has been part of a core group that has been deeply trusted by Mr Putin.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed Special Representative for the environment and transport.
A Kremlin statement said Mr Putin had "announced the removal of Ivanov's head of the Office of the President of the Russian president," but did not give reasons.
Anton Vaino, who began to act as the deputy to Mr Ivanov in 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he managed the president's draft and government staff, said the Kremlin's website (in Russian).
After his appointment, he said to Mr Putin, "thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of this government is to support the head of state in drafting laws and control instructions.
Mr Putin told Russian television Friday that Mr Ivanov himself had asked to resign and recommended Mr Vaino to take over.
Is such a smile convincing?
Moscow is puzzled by the move.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Putin's closest aides, and, like Mr Putin, has worked at the Soviet security agency.
As head of the Executive Office, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
At a meeting with President Vladimir Putin on national television, both said it was the chief executive's own request to resign.
Despite all the smiles in front of the camera, almost no one is convinced - especially before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this the result of the defeat of some kind of power struggle?
It is not yet known.
But the official statement - a man who had been seen as a candidate for the presidency suddenly chose to take the helm of Russia's environmental policy - drew a lot of suspicion.
"Yes, at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to give me this difficult position, or even a troublesome position, for four years, "he said on the Kremlin's website.
"As a result, I have been the head of the Office of the President for four years and eight months. "
Mr Ivanov held the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Mr Putin, is a former member of the National Security Agency.
At the end of the 1990s, when Mr Putin became the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly the National Security Agency), Mr Ivanov was appointed deputy.
After Mr Putin came to power, he also appointed Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might be president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, because the three-term re-election was unconstitutional.
But the position ultimately belongs to another close aide to Mr Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Before returning to the presidency three and a half years later, Mr Putin served as Prime Minister of Russia.
The mysterious fish is found in a garden
A resident of Banff found fish living in his garden and then asked for help.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be a sand eel that was blown by a tornado in the sea.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a video of the strange scene on the Periscope, hoping that someone could explain why these two inches of fish would appear.
The Kunsferri Bridge has now passed to Fife
The $1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017
Engineers have linked the north deck of the Queensferry bridge to the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
The "deck fan", located near the three bridgehead in each major bridge, is now close to completion, and the project is the first bridge to join the dragon.
The bridge, which started in Fife, is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 metric tons.
It uses 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 cables.
The -pound project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economy minister Keith Brown visited the scene today and became one of the first people to board the bridge.
"This is a historic moment in the construction of the Kunsferri Bridge, "he said.
We have all witnessed the engineering work on such an ambitious project, in which more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel were used in this section of the bridge.
Although the size and weight of the bridge are enormous, it takes fine work to complete the bridge between the viaduct and the deck, requiring very precise Assembly.
Overall, the total deck of the near 79% has now been installed, and the final deck of the concrete deck is being cast in Rosyth today, that is to say, all the decks are ready to be put in place.
"It's a major milestone, "said Michael Martin, the project director of the Kunsferri Bridge construction company." No matter which bridge project, the first dragon is a major milestone. "
As far as the great project is concerned, the dragon shows cutting-edge civil engineering technology.
After installing the last piece of pavement and connecting it to the expanded North Bridge Road board, it will be necessary to complete the remaining gap on the north side or near the land side.
To complete the operation, it is necessary to move the northern elevated approach South by 700 mm.
This is a huge operation, and it is also a very sophisticated operation.
It is huge because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 metric tons, and needs to be pulled out of a slope of about 3%.
It is sophisticated because the engineering team needs to ensure that the deviations are very small, with only a few millimetres on each side.
It is gratifying to note that everything is going well.
Simon Bayes won the women's gymnastics all-around champion
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is not affected by all this.
The vault was full of energy.
The balance beam is more than the upper edge.
The floor exercise is amazing.
The overall performance was excellent.
Now, it has finally become the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the all-round championship Thursday and demonstrated her ability to lead the world in gymnastics at the Olympic Games.
She is far above the silver medal winner, the "Final Five" player Aly Raisman and the bronze medal winner, Mustafana, with 62.198's total score.
Simon Bayes, from the United States, performed the balance beam on Thursday at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in the women's individual all-around final.
Byrs helped the United States to win four titles at the Olympic women's gymnastics individual all-around, and her individual won five medals at the Olympics, further confirming that she was this generation, and probably the best gymnast ever.
When he saw his total score, byrs couldn't help but shed tears. She finally ended the long journey.
As a result, Byers ranks among the "decades-old athletes" like Michael Phelps, who elevate sports programs in their respective fields to new heights:
"Byers is the best gymnast I've ever seen," Byers said. "Byers is the best gymnast I've ever seen," Byers said. "Byers is the best gymnast I've ever seen," Byers said in the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton.
There is a final game in Brazil, but the game is not so much the rivalry between byrs and other gymnasts, but rather a contest between herself and the pressure of great expectations.
If byrs did not return to her home in Spring, Texas, without a full gold medal, everyone would have been very disappointed.
Simon Bayes (left) and Raisman embraced each other, winning gold and silver medals in the women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August.
Byers won his first gold medal on Tuesday, giving a nice gift to the retiring national coach, Martha Karolyi.
Although byrs insisted that he did not plan the future in the process of holding the championship all the year round, it was not exactly the case.
It was a segment of the floor exercise, including her signature churning string, with Latin music, which she often listened to in a one-street shelter with the Rio Olympic stadium.
This is no coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by his grandparents at the time of the baby, and was found by the coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym, has now grown into a backbone.
Since the summer of 2013, byrs has not lost in the all-round game, and she will win as long as he wants to win.
Mustafina's slight lead after two rotations is just an illusion.
The balance beam was lying in wait for the defending world champion of the two projects in the floor exercise.
She scored 15.433 on the balance beam and the floor exercise scored 15.933.
By the time he waited for the final score, Lesman held byrs gently, and when he learned that he had achieved his dream, he left a tear.
Raisman's performance was a bit like revenge for four years ago, when she was tied third, but lost to Mustafana in the .
But this time, it was hailed as the 22-year-old leader of "grandma" by the Americans.
She blew kisses to the crowd at the end of the floor exercise and declared a return, but such a return sometimes appeared to be in doubt.
Byrs is only 19 years old. Since earlier this week, the news has spread on Twitter, and for byrs, his life has been given a whole new meaning.
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown survived the shooting in Philadelphia
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old child who was shot in the city this week.
The children's grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child who had been shot was Mahaj Brown.
They said there were multiple gunshot wounds in Brown's groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but the child was awake on the way to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot of crime, and the little body was riddled with bullets, "his grandmother Delores Melendez told the television station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
His family told the television station that the child was expected to recover.
He would have started the first grade at a local primary school.
Brown is one of four people who have been shot in the Germantown area.
Of the three others who had been shot, two were 29 years old and one was 32 years old.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims was in critical condition; the other two victims were in stable condition.
The child and the 29-year-old victim were found in the front seat of the car, the TV station said.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether gunmen were among the injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looks like an exchange of gunfire between multiple gunmen.
A number of cases of assault weapons were found at the scene, which could be inferred that they were using different offensive weapons.
Judging by this, there is no doubt that this is a continuing battle.
There were shells on the pavement on both sides of the street.
"So there were a number of armed men on the scene at the time, "the Philadelphia police chief, Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
A number of homes and vehicles were damaged in the area.
No arrests have been made and police are said to be looking at surveillance video.
On Tuesday, a six-year-old child (girl) was shot in the arm by a stray bullet while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane community.
She is now recovering and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabrielle and Laurie
This is how I evaluate this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, since 1984, I have been to every Summer Olympics, but the United States has never been so dominant.
Second, the gymnastics team has three excellent gymnasts - Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, who have been inspiring many coloured girls.
The composition of the team is a source of pride for everyone, because it contains the Raisman of Judaism and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
The team finally looked like the United States.
It also consolidated black and Latino women at the top of the sport.
In the past four years, the leading female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabrielle ranked first and second.
That's too bad.
The US was cheered by the fact that the last Olympics, Gabrielle Douglas "unexpectedly" became the Olympic champion.
Today, the world is able to witness the performance of the three World Champions Simon Bayes, Douglas and Laurie Ernandez, who have performed the conventional gymnastics skills to the best of their ability.
On Thursday, Simone helped the U.S. Team achieve four titles in the women's individual all-around project.
Her team-mate Ali Raisman took the silver medal.
We climbed to the top of the sport, but this was not the case in the all-american gymnastics teaching class.
Simone, Gabrielle and Laurie have access to the Olympic team in the same way as Ali and Madison.
They are "Final Five" because the next Olympic Gymnastics team will be made up of four gymnasts, the last year of Marta Karolyi's coaching.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a costly exercise, and gymnasts are trained mainly in private gymnastics clubs, whose parents need to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (including the costs associated with coaches and gymnasts and family members), and the cost list is growing.
Most of the gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburbs that can provide support for the industry.
All the training of gymnasts is done at these clubs, and it is a long and expensive expense for the gymnasts' families.
His coach Aimee Boorman and Hernandez's coach, Maggie Haney, has been teaching them all the time since the two gymnasts began to practice gymnastics.
We have to bring more affordable, more accessible gymnastics to a myriad of young girls who are deeply affected by Simone, Gabrielle and Laurie.
Twenty years ago, I set up my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we offer free, low-cost gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Hispanic Americans) in the black residential area, and develop a national and even world champion.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this learning opportunity and will benefit from this remarkable Olympic movement.
Gymnastics helps to cultivate the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the cultivation of hard-working spirit, self-discipline and determination.
These can be life-long benefits for a person's health, academic and career success.
Inspired by the team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in sports is of great significance, especially for girls.
It was an exciting moment.
Thanks to the "Girl Power" shown by Simone, Ali, Laurie, and Madison in winning the gold medal of the Olympic group, they also thank them for inspiring so many young girls with diverse backgrounds to open the path to health, strength and success.
Following the rejection of the Jeremy Hunter proposal, the junior doctor planned to launch a further strike
The ministers initially wanted to put an end to the change-induced dispute by accepting a revised contract by the British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58% was opposed to the contract by 58%, a junior doctor who voted for the vote.
In July, Mr Hunter revealed plans to impose a contract, saying that the NHS is now in a "vacuum zone" and that a slight delay would harm the interests of employees and patients.
The new contract first referred to the modification of the working practices of junior doctors throughout the night and weekends to improve the care of irregular working hours.
"The primary doctor still has serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will exacerbate the current labour crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly, "Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA junior doctor's Committee, said in a statement last night.
There are only eight weeks left to sign a new contract with the first doctors, and we need to make progress, and we don't have much time.
BMA tried to resolve the dispute through negotiation, but everyone was reluctant to participate, and sometimes the Government responded with silence.
Even so, last month we got the Jeremy Hunter's promise, and he said his door was always open.
"Jeremy Hunter now needs to take action to eliminate mandatory enforcement and address the concerns of junior doctors.
If he does not, the junior doctor has made it clear that they are ready to take further labour action.
The last strike, which took place at the end of April, led to nearly 13,000 routine surgery and an extension of the 100,000 case, as nurses and consultation doctors took cover for doctors on the picket line.
The ministers initially hoped to put an end to the changing dispute by accepting BMA's revised contract.
BMA hopes to secure a better weekend salary for the 54,000 junior doctor involved in the contract.
NHS Employers chief executive Daniel Mortimer called on junior doctors to refrain from any further strikes.
"Labor action has been ineffective, but it has put pressure on already dedicated teams and services, leading to fear, anxiety and confusion among patients, caregivers and their families, "Mr. Mortimer said.
Over the past two months, we have been negotiating with the junior doctors' Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other departments, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of the guardian and the disclosure of the report.
Employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics, such as deployment, training flexibility, other training, training costs, common knowledge of curriculum outlines, study leave and gender wage differentials in the medical field, which show the importance attached by employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health to the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A drug of 2 pounds a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Officials have suggested that a drug of 2 pounds a day be extended to more patients and to prolong the medication, and thousands of heart patients will benefit from the drug.
Anti-coagulation plasma Ticagrelor can reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence in patients with heart disease.
The drug, which lasts for 12 months after a heart attack, lowers the risk of a stroke or heart attack.
The National Institute for health and clinical excellence (nice), a regulator of the NHS, advises patients to continue taking medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now NHS regulator NICE has advised patients to continue taking the drug for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about a quarter of them suffer from heart disease each year, and a quarter of them continue to suffer from a heart attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the formation of plaque by fatty substances in the arterial wall.
If the plaque is disconnected, it can lead to thrombosis, which prevents blood flow into the heart, leading to a heart attack.
If the clot moves, it enters the bloodstream, blocking the flow of blood into the brain, causing a stroke.
Patients who have experienced a heart attack have a higher risk of having a heart attack.
Cargret, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and is marketed under the name of Behrinda, can reduce the risk of disease by reducing the formation of thrombosis.
The nice draft, released today, advises patients to take 90 mg of Cargret 12 months, followed by 60 mg of Cargret and two aspirin a day for the next three years.
"Although there are effective secondary prevention treatments, up to a quarter of those who have a history of heart attack have a re-onset or stroke, usually with serious consequences, "said professor Carole Longson, director of the health technology assessment centre.
Fear of relapse can have a significant negative effect on a person's quality of life.
The evidence suggests that the combination of Cargret and aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients who have experienced a heart attack.
We are heartened by the fact that Cargret's provisional recommendation will provide more treatment options for thousands of people who benefit.
Because of the limited information about the efficacy and safety of Cargret after three years, in particular the risk of bleeding, the draft guidance does not recommend the continuation of treatment after this period.
Computer culture has led to the prevalence of "electoral fraud" in the Muslim region
Tower Hamlets's former mayor, Rahman, was sacked last year as a result of corruption, prompting a government report to be published.
The "political correctness" culture turns a blind eye to the widespread election fraud in the Muslim community, and this anti-lethal government report reveals today.
The former cabinet minister, Sir Eric Pickles, accused the police, election regulators and the city hall of turning a blind eye to the evidence of an abuse of the election because of "over-sensitivity to ethnic divisions and religious issues ".
The former Minister of community affairs, the current director of anti-corruption, said the police should be allowed to set up a cordon outside the polling stations to protect the frightened voters by taking religious positions to intimidate voters.
He suggested that voters carry their identity documents when they vote in order to prove their identity.
At present, voters only need to report their own name and address.
The report even suggested the use of indelible ink on voters' fingers to prevent a second vote.
Sir Eric said efforts should be made to strengthen the protection of reporters.
He called for increased media access to the documents of the Conference and the decisions taken by the non-official Committee or working group.
"This is not just to guard against electoral fraud, but to protect the local government from a widespread culture of corruption and the poison of financial fraud that is closely associated with it, "he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street after the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special Electoral Tribunal ruled that the incumbent mayor, Rahman, had a series of corruption and lawlessness, and should be dismissed.
The court found that Rahman "grossly abused" the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and was silent about his allegations of racial discrimination and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to "claim to vote for him in the election as a religious duty of a loyal Muslim."
As many as 300 votes are in doubt, it may be that voters fake others to vote.
Sir Eric says there is evidence of electoral fraud across the country.
In particular, he warned of fraud by mail, and senior members of the Muslim community were said to have put pressure on voters to vote for the candidate they had appointed.
Sir Eric (in the photo) gave a number of suggestions for clearing the voting mechanism, including taking good identification documents to prove his identity
"The evidence suggests that senior members, particularly in Pakistan and Bangladesh, have put pressure on vulnerable groups in minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote in accordance with their wishes, "he said in his report.
"Because of over-sensitivity to ethnic divisions and religious' political correctness', they fear that State institutions will turn a blind eye to such behavior. "
Sir Eric has proposed 50 recommendations to clean up the electoral mechanism, including a ban on political activists handling mail voting documents to prevent "voting gains."
The report also calls for an investigation into the registration of information to prevent the electoral rolls from being used for immigration and welfare fraud. Theresa May is also considering the report.
These proposals include requiring voters to produce identification documents before voting.
The vote was followed by an indelible ink on the voters' fingers to prevent a second vote.
A systematic verification of the ethnic affiliation of the electorate in order to ensure eligibility for voting.
The validity of the automatic mailing request is limited to three years.
Political activists and militants are prohibited from dealing with completed mailing ballots and mailing ballot envelopes.
Police are authorized to set up a cordon around the polling stations.
Amend the provisions of the law to make it easier to accuse the person concerned of the crime of intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983.
It is illegal to provide for photographs at the polling stations.
Provision is made for the use of English only in polling stations (with the exception of the Welsh region).
(C) to strengthen training to ensure that staff strictly enforce the requirement that "voters go to the polling hall alone".
Sir Eric denounced the Metropolitan Police (Metropolitan Police), saying it was "surprising" that they had not filed any criminal charges in the wake of the Tower Hamlets incident.
"There is a lot of corruption and lawlessness in Rahman and its electoral officers, so they have been disqualified by the Electoral Tribunal, "he said.
In accordance with the standards of criminal certification, he is unquestionably guilty in many respects.
He was also critical of the "check box check" of the city hall election registration department.
"Last year, the court heard a wake-up call for the Tower Hamlets decision, "said Sir Eric.
Our country has a glorious tradition of "the mother of Parliament", but it is also a matter of concern that some of the agencies ' private clandestine election fraud and hindsight are a source of concern, as well as a threat to this good reputation.

The CBC Olympic commentator apologized for the comments made by Chinese swimmers "as slow as pigs"
On Wednesday, Byron MacDonald's comments on the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan, who won the fourth place in the women's 4x200 meter freestyle relay, angered viewers who watched the live broadcast of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Olympic Games
A spokeswoman for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation CBC said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer would "swim faster than the stench" in the race and finally "just as slow as a pig", after which CBC was forced to apologize.
Narrator Byron MacDonald made some of his views at the end of the women's 4x200 meter freestyle relay final, when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
"The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake, "said Byron, a" colored glasses "commentator on the final CBC commentator's team.
Because he was so excited, he began to swim faster than the stench, but later it was as slow as a pig.
It's thanks to her, too.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, Ai, was the second best, using 1:57.79 - behind Canada's Taylor Ruck 1.61 second, which led Canada to narrow the gap with China.
The entire Canadian audience was surprised by the tone and wording of the narrator, who quickly responded to the network
"The CBC commentator said that China's 14-year-old swimmer was' as slow as a pig '? "
The idiot didn't realize it was broadcast live.
"The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake, "said Ai, a Chinese teenager who took part in the women's 4x200 meter freestyle relay final.
Twitter's criticism of Byron MacDonald quickly swept over Twitter, and many people asked him to withdraw from the commentary.
When Twitter users heard that Byron MacDonald was slow to respond to this, they did not stop there.
Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wow # Byron MacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and your words and actions make us all sound like a bunch of racist. # it's really annoying.
Shortly after, CBC radio presenter Scott Russel apologized for Byron's comments, saying: "We apologize for the comments on the live swimmer's performance."
"We are sorry to have such an untimely wording, "he said.
CBC apologized to those Twitter users who responded to the speech more than 90 times
Another commentator, Scott Russel, also made an apology on behalf of Byron
The CBC then copied their apologies to more than 90 other twitter users who protested against Byron
The channel also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We are extremely sorry to have said such a thing and broadcast it live.
Last night, we acted quickly to apologize to the viewers who watched us live, as well as to our audience on social media.
It is important to note that Byron's explanation is aimed at the performance of swimmers, but not against her.
That is to say, the wording is really inappropriate, and Byron is deeply sorry for it.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast, saying his words did not mean a personal attack, and tried to justify his comments.
"I'd like to take some time to apologize for what I said at the end of the women's relay race last night," he said on the CBC Olympics broadcast.
"I'm just commenting on the performance of swimmers, not on their individual."
"Of course, I don't mean I don't respect it, I'm sorry. "
Primark customers expressed anger at a woman who had the audacity to try on his underwear in the middle of the store
A woman undressed in the middle of a Primark shop where customers didn't know where to look.
Even worse, she looked at how she looked, and then took off her underwear and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelves and eventually tried four pairs of underwear at the store in Folkestone's Bouverie Place shopping center.
The woman tried on her underwear in the Primark store at Folkestone's Bouverie Place shopping center, and then put it back on the shelf
Also inside the store, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children, said the mysterious woman was "dressed again and went out of the shop and didn't buy anything."
"People can't believe what they see, "she said.
She stood in the middle of the store, took a pair of underwear from the shelf, took off her tight pants and underwear, and then put it on.
"She didn't try to find a secluded place to try it on - she was just standing there, so brazen. "
"When she took off her underwear again, everyone was stunned, and apparently she was not satisfied, because she put her underwear back on the shelf. "
After that, she tried three more, and finally found that none of them liked it, and then dressed again and went out of the shop.
"She didn't seem to care if someone was looking at her - or wondering who would end up buying the underwear she tried to pass. "
Ms. Davidson (33, who lives in Kent town) said: "I feel sick at the thought that someone will buy underwear that other people walk through and have not been washed."
It happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "After she left, the shop assistant apparently had to deal with these underwear, fortunately."
"I hate to buy a new pair of underwear, but I find another woman trying to get through and has not been cleaned."
"Primark already knows what happened in our Folkestone store on August 9 (Tuesday)," a Primark spokesman said.
All the problematic commodities have been removed from the shelves.
How to protect yourself by using ma in a gun attack
The world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail. Com may give you a sense of security.
We asked Rhon Mizrachi master Rhon Mizrachi, New York, to learn how to deal with the gunman at close range.
Whether he is from the front or behind you, the video will teach you how to turn the tables.
If the gunman is close to you from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and "clear the line," Mizrachi said.
Then, hold the gun with the forearm and shoulder, and then hit the attacker on the face with your elbow.
Then with his knee on his groin, when the attacker bent down because of pain, he turned the gun in his hand, hit his face with the barrel and the back-up gun group, and kept his weapon at him.
If the gunman is close to the front, use a similar technique - keep your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and reverse the muzzle so that the gunman can't fire.
At the same time, put the weight on the gun and hit the attacker's chest and turn the muzzle from his clenched hand, then point the gun at him.
Sounds complicated?
Check the video to see how Mizrachi actually did it.
But remember, if you're not a master of ma, the safest way to get rid of the robbery is to hand over cash.
A rogue family destroyed the low-rent house in Sortash, Cornwall, before being deported
A rogue family, who had been expelled for intimidating neighbours, had destroyed the low-rent house in his house before leaving, causing a loss of more than 50,000 pounds.
After a long list of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and his husband, Shaun Trebilcock, were driven out of the low-rent house in Sortash, Cornwall.
After being forcibly removed from the house, the housing association officials were surprised to find that there had been serious damage.
There were holes in the walls, the floor was torn, and the rubbish was strewn all over the floor, and the walls were smeared.
After being expelled, the family has been moving, and is said to be living in private homes
Donna McEvoy, a housing manager at Cornwall Housing society, said she was worried that the house could not be saved.
"It's a nightmare for people who live here, and I don't think people can live like that, "she said.
There are a lot of things to weigh on now, because the house is likely to be a less good element in Cornwall.
The family is notorious, and their names are equally notorious.
The couple, who have three sons, will live here from time to time, the police say, including the use of baseball bats to fight in the streets, intimidation of nearby residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, shouting, arguing and swearing.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant named Skeldon received a resolution on antisocial behaviour.
In the house that might have been demolished, many of the rooms were filled with rubbish for a long time
In this room where drugs were once traded, the floor was lifted
Neighbors said they often saw them fighting in the streets and often called the police
After an extended period of 11 weeks to allow them to leave voluntarily, the Cornwall Housing Association forcibly removed her from the house this week with her husband.
The neighbors, who had finally breathed sighs of relief, said that the previous life was a hell of a world.
"They don't care about anyone, "one neighbour said.
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it's been so bad.
On countless occasions, we have seen the police come to the door.
"We couldn't sleep this morning, "he said.
We got up early because it was so quiet - we weren't used to it!
It was very nice of them to leave at last.
'the family didn't work well with the local government,' said Adam Fitzpatrick, a community executive manager of Cornwall Housing Association.
The family lived in the house for 20 years and the police often visited
Garbage and old toys were dumped on the side of the low-rent house
He added: "It is regrettable that the tenant did not bear any responsibility for her behaviour with her family and that the eviction was the last consideration of the Cornwall Housing society."
This is a very difficult case to deal with, because their behavior is extremely extreme, and their actions must be a source of great fear to the neighbors.
I thank my team for the work it has done, and I would like to thank the Devon and Cornwall Police, as well as members of the community who are brave enough to provide us with information.
I hope this will bring some comfort to the neighbors and send the message that we will not tolerate anti-social behaviour.
Mr Fitzpatrick said their three sons had lived in the house at different times, but said they were both in their twenties.
After they were expelled, a dirty mattress was also thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms
The housing association workers will soon clean up piles of rubbish around the house
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, as well as scales, drugs and a pound of cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of class B drugs and drug-trafficking intent.
She claim. that the money was used to buy a tombstone for her son Lee Skeldon who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is understood that after being homeless, Tanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth.
Graffiti was painted on the walls of many rooms in the house.
Police say they will evict tenants who defy the tenant's rules.
Mr Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the expulsion sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to defy the tenant's rules.
"This warning is aimed at those who think their actions will not be blamed, as well as those who have been devastated by such behaviour, "she said.
Devon and Cornwall Police will not tolerate crime and antisocial behaviour, and they will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Reed: Hillary Clinton will nominate Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said he was confident that if the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, was elected president, she would nominate the Garland judge to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked confirmation of Garland since the Barack Obama presidential nomination in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would choose the person to replace the late Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
In a conference call on Thursday, Reid said he predicted that Clinton would opt for "some credibility" Merrick Garland.
A spokeswoman for reed later said Reid had not asked whether he would nominate Garland to talk directly to Mr Clinton and said he was just guessing.
He praised the Garland and said that Clinton's team did not want to "disrupt" the new candidate.
Garland is the chief justice of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in the United States District of Columbia.
Mr Reid said the Republicans who blocked the Garland nomination were the "favorites" and "achievers" of Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate.
He said Trump was not fit to be president.
"Treats": the nude calendar "both men and women love"
The Treats magazine will work hand in hand with photographer David Bellemere to take a group of inspiration from the 2017 calendar of Pirelli in the 1970s.
This time, they plan to look for a new generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar, rather than the famous nude.
Steve Shaw, president of Treats, said earlier this year that their -based magazines were different from the old-fashioned Playboy, because "the latter is for men."
And we are facing women.
Obviously, he thinks the same is true of this group of calendars.
"We need to show the timeless and classic nudity that makes women and men feel comfortable, and this time it's inspired, "Shaw said at a calendar presentation.
Women will be happy to take part in the shooting because it is a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit photos online and apply in person to the open recruitment sites in Los Angeles and New York.
The video report shows: The head sleeping shark is the longest-lived vertebrate
Greenland shark is one of the longest-lived vertebrates on Earth, scientists say.
Julius Nielsen, who has been studying sharks, says it has been documented that the age of a female head sleeping shark is expected to be between 272 and 512 years of age, up to five metres in length.
The French court dismissed the petition for the demolition of shops in the Jungle camp
A French court rejected a petition by the Government of Calais to dismantle dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the "jungle" camp, where thousands of refugees are currently living in the camp.
At the court's hearings this week, the Government of Calais argued that the French government should have the right to demolish 72 makeshift shops in the camp, selling goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offering hairdressing services, and selling tea at 50 cents (40 pence) in makeshift restaurants or selling basic meals at a price of a few euros.
The Office of the governor of Calais believes that these places should be dismantled, as they are parallel economies that do not pay taxes, and there are fire and health hazards.
Humanitarian groups have indicated to the court that these shops and restaurants are of great importance because the free food provided by state-supported associations and other groups is simply unable to meet the needs of the growing refugee population in the camp.
These makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need, they say.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the 72 temporary shops, but said the concerns of the governor of Calais were "perfectly understandable."
The role of these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants is far more than simply providing food to refugees who "live under extremely dangerous conditions," said judge Jean Francois Molla.
He says these places are a calm point of convergence between refugees and volunteers.
One of the threats was the "Jungle Book Kids" Cafe in the refugee camp, which provided 200 food, English and French classes a day, and offered asylum advice for hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the cafe.
A letter to the Guardian wrote that the closure of the cafe "would be a major disaster for these children, many of whom are only eight years old."
The two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, predicted Friday that the number of refugees in the Jungle camp had exceeded 9,000, the highest level since the surge in the number of refugees in the summer.
"This 5,000 yuan will help me solve my immediate needs, "he said.
Zhou Fen, the poor founder of Michael township Michael village in Huayuan County, received a letter of acceptance from South China University.
Just as she worried about the cost of admission, on August 9, the county Party committee gave her five thousand yuan in time.
In the past few days, more than 690 poverty-stricken University students have been funded by the county authorities.
At the same time, the economic situation of the family is particularly difficult, and through the organization of social donations and other forms of assistance to help them complete their studies.
Huayuan this year consolidated student funds more than 18.5 million yuan, the financial self-financing of more than 2.5 million yuan, by the financial department in accordance with the prescribed time-frame into the poor student's real name card.
"I thought my father died, and my brother and I couldn't go to college," she said gratefully. "I didn't expect the county to solve our difficulties in time."
As of August 8, Huayuan had implemented a variety of rescue funds of more than 21 million yuan for the first half of this year for 13,140 poor students.
All the poverty-stricken students in this County have achieved the assistance that should be helped, and the supplement has been filled.

The New South Wales state government announced Tuesday that it would spend $200 million ($154 million) on the biggest renovation of the famous Sydney Opera House since it was built.
The New South Wales state government said the repairs would not change the shape of the shell of the opera house.

The Sydney Opera House, the General Manager of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, believes the Sydney Opera House will use the makeover to become "one of the best acoustics in the world."
Non-beijing-based citizens who live in Beijing for more than six months and meet one of the conditions of legitimate and stable employment, legal stability and continuing education in Beijing may apply for a residence permit.
Recently, Beijing's provisional regulations on residence permits have been introduced, which means that the "temporary residence permit" will be upgraded to "residence permit".
The shift from "temporary residence permit" to "residence permit" means that Beijing will shift from "management" to a multi-directional service to a non-beijing resident population, according to the head of the relevant department.
The reporter learned today from the State Administration of Taxation that, as of the end of June this year, tax authorities at all levels have published 2,470 cases of illegal "blacklist" cases.
It is understood that, in July 2014, the State Administration of Taxation took a first step in the functions of the central government and, in conjunction with the tax credit management method, published the Information Disclosure method for major tax offences.
Not only the illegal facts of these cases, the legal basis, the handling of the punishment will be published, and the basic information of the law-breaking parties, as well as those responsible for the relevant intermediary institutions, will also be included in the "blacklist".
The quality control, finance, customs and other government departments have also taken relevant disciplinary measures against the "blacklist" parties.
"Credit repair mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of tax credit system and even the whole social credit system, which marks the development of our country's social credit system, which is becoming more and more mature. "
"Environmental problems are manifested in the air, water and soil pollution, but the roots are still in the mode of production. "
In 2015, for example, the land development degree in Jiangsu Province was as high as 21%, the highest in the provinces and autonomous regions of the country.
Therefore, the problem of high pollution, large energy and multi-floor area has not been fundamentally dealt with in the transformation of the way of production and living.
On the one hand, from the results of the creation of ecological environment at all levels in Jiangsu Province, it ranks first in the country with absolute superiority; on the other hand, the resource environment carries a lot of pressure.
In order to promote the protection and management of the ecological environment, we need to push forward the transformation of the mode of production and living in a fundamental way, so as to promote the transformation of the people's livelihood through the construction of ecological civilization.

It is reported that the national flag is expected to arrive in Rio on November 11 and will be sent to various Olympic venues after receiving the national flag. The whole process will be completed under the supervision of the Chinese Embassy and consulate in Brazil.
On the 10th of this report, Nantong Municipal Government held a joint venture with Shanghai International Conference Center at the Shanghai International Conference Center. More than 180 Shanghai enterprises were invited to participate, and 20 billion yuan were signed on the site.
A total of 20 projects, with a total investment of $8.063 billion, relate to new sources of energy, new materials, modern services, and other industries.
Qingdao is the 12th of the country as well as the first pilot city in Shandong Province for the use and trading of emissions.
On the 11 th, a number of enterprises have come to Qingdao emission trading center to submit emission rights requisition, the requisition will pay the paid user fees.
The deal, which is about to be completed, will also herald the opening of the Qingdao emission trading pilot, which will also be the first list of emissions trading in the Province and the city's municipal emissions trading.
On the morning of November 11, the General Manager of Qingdao double peach Fine Chemical (Group) Co., Ltd., came to the Qingdao emission trading center to submit emission rights requisition.
The company is located in the old city of Qingdao, at the end of last year, completely shut down, environmental relocation to the new plant.
After the Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, the construction project environmental impact statement and other materials, the Qingdao emission Reserve and Trading Service Center began the first trial of the application materials.
According to the standards set by the price and finance departments of Qingdao, the initial cost of the initial emission emission is about 641,200 yuan, and the staff will complete the approval within seven working days.
The deal to be completed will also herald the start of the pilot work on emission trading in Qingdao, which will also be the first list of emissions trading in the Province and the capital of the city's municipal emissions trading.
Zhao Xiuping said that the current enterprise environmental protection has invested up to 400 million, on the surface is huge, but has a great impact on the business management concept and social benefits, and also opened up space for enterprise innovation management.
On the same day, Qingdao quartet xinchengzhi passenger car accessories Co. Ltd. also came to the annual output of 4,200 high-speed rail and emu interior accessories project requisition emission rights.
The project belongs to the mechanical processing enterprise, and the initial emission right for the application is the chemical oxygen demand (COD) 0.514 ton, ammonia nitrogen (NOX) 0.052 tons.
The emission of air pollutants can be used and traded for the city's power and heat production supply key industrial enterprises.
The existing sewerage units, which have obtained the EIA before 1 January 2016, will not be subject to paid user fees for the time being.
"The acquisition of emission rights is not equal to obtaining the power of illegal discharge, and does not emit pollutants at random. "
The deputy director of the Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau, Han Hongyan, said that if illegal pollution is still to be punished according to relevant regulations, it is not possible to allow illegal enterprises to avoid punishment by purchasing emission rights.
In other words, it is necessary to crack down on environmental violations through legal means, severely punish enterprises for over-discharge, thereby protecting the environment and ensuring public health.
Now the enterprise, for its own benefit, increases the enthusiasm of pollution prevention, cherishes the limited emission rights, and reduces the pollutant discharge.
In order to protect the environment, protect nature and protect the public health, it has been driven by economic interests to reduce the discharge of pollutants from the compulsory behavior of the Government to the self-conscious market behavior of the enterprise.
Emission rights, also known as "rights to emit", are the right to discharge pollutants, referring to the right of emitters to discharge pollutants into the environment according to law within the limits allocated by the Government.
This right is, in essence, the right to possess, use and benefit from the resources of the environmental capacity.
The next step, on the premise that the total emission of pollutants does not exceed allowable emissions, transfers the amount of pollution to each other through the exchange of money between the various sources of pollution.
Emissions trading has since been put forward by the US economist Dales in 1968, and the United States has applied it to the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources since the 1970s.
Since 2007, China has launched a pilot project, which has now been fully implemented in 14 provinces (districts and cities), including Zhejiang and Jiangsu.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, in order to assist the six strategic bombers in carrying out air strikes against the Islamic State in Syria, a number of Russian warplanes have launched their support from the Syrian Hermaim air base.
On February 22 this year, the United States and Russia reached an agreement on a ceasefire between the parties to the Syrian conflict, which began on the 27th of that month.
According to the agreement, the ceasefire does not include military strikes against terrorist groups identified by the United Nations Security Council, such as the Islamic State.
Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure at the base, and the living conditions of the Russian soldiers will be protected accordingly.
He added that these forces would be extended to Russia without a crackdown on extremist forces.
While Russia and the West have not reached an agreement on a joint crackdown on extremist forces, Russia will strengthen cooperation with Syria, Iran and Iraq in this regard.
In September 2015, Russia began a military strike against the extremist forces at the invitation of the Syrian government.
On March 15 this year, Russia's main military forces began to withdraw, but the Russian side promised to continue to retain the Hermaim airbase and the naval base in tartous.
In the case of the new and successful countryside, the He Peijun made a good demonstration: The inheritance of a century old house, as well as a story of the inheritance of a piece of land.
Today, an average of 100,000 people gather at bamboo hill each year, or bring about a variety of ideas, or seek inner peace.
In fact, the relationship between the country and the city should be accompanied by one another, like a mother and a child, with no power or strength, no one who needs to rule, and should be very warm.
There is no fixed pattern for rural development, but it is difficult to make a spontaneous change in the countryside, and the most important thing is to let the right people go to the country.
The Shanghai Songjiang District Administration Department recently used an electronic police regulation driver to drive a mobile phone, and seized more than 30 cases a week.
With the popularity of smart phones, mobile phones are becoming more and more fun, micro-informatics, micro-blogging and even playing games, shopping for Taobao are normal, many people seem to be unable to leave their mobile phones, even when driving.
The road traffic safety Act explicitly prohibits driving on mobile phones and defines it as "an impediment to safe driving."
Unfortunately, this phenomenon has not been punished as a result of the number of offenders and the difficulty of obtaining evidence, and the provisions of the law are almost furnished.
If the authorities are determined to "declare war" on driving their mobile phones, the violation is bound to be curbed.

In a collective greenhouse in Donglin village in Taicang City, the 48-year-old Wang Xuefen is carrying workers to spray pesticides on a pear tree.
In the village, 150 acres of orchards, more than 10 species of trees, require only 12 workers plus one technical engineer.
A total of 50,000 yuan last year, like my age, wouldn't be able to get the money if I worked in a factory.
Last year, the village income of donglam village reached 22 million yuan, of which total agricultural income accounted for nearly half.
Village clerk Su Q ifang: The per capita land area is rising every year. It has just begun 50 mu, now more than 100 acres, and the benefits of Mu are increasing every year, and the income of professional farmers is growing every year.
The biggest bright spot of the rural collective economic reform in southern Jiangsu Province is to clarify the collective business assets property rights of rural areas and explore the separation of the government.
In July 2015, 14 rural economic co-operation organizations in the Xishan District of Wuxi City and the village village Committee, the village committee, carry out the management of rural public affairs, while the cooperative organizations are mainly engaged in business.
The two institutions have two accounts, not "relations", to prevent the participation of village cadres in the collective assets management of corruption.
The next step in Jiangsu will continue to promote the reform of the community joint-stock system, encourage the joint development of farmers and establish a democratic power running mechanism at the village level, said Zhu Baoping, deputy director of the agriculture committee of Jiangsu Province.
Zhu B aoping: Further push forward the reform, engage in community equity cooperation, quantify the assets to members, fix them to the farmers, and form clear property rights.
Through the Internet +, the implementation of his right to know, the right to participate in decision-making and the supervision of democratic management, three rights are implemented to the farmers, and it is true that it becomes the operating mechanism of the normative share cooperation.
At present, the new collective economy of southern Jiangsu Province mainly forms the model of asset leasing, enterprise equity, agricultural development and joint development.

Xiamen girl Zhang Binbin: "The beauty of the hand" began to shoot the road career has been "reversed"
Zhang Donghong, a Zhang Donghong village in the Shangan District of Xiamen, has just switched 29 inches of old TV to a 65-inch TV in the past few days.
The average farmer's daughter is Zhang Binbin, who won a silver medal in the women's 50m rifle at the Rio Olympics on the evening of November.
On the 11th night, just before the new TV, the Zhang Donghong couple, together with dozens of relatives and friends, watched her daughter catch up with a magical process that had been eliminated from almost the heat to almost a big reversal.
In the game of the day, Zhang Binbin was once in the middle and lower reaches, seemingly far away from the final.
But parents and family and friends did not give up, brush the text live, see with the other players to finish, Zhang Binbin ranking all the way up, eventually lock the final seat, his home suddenly burst from a burst of cheers.
In the final, Zhang Binbin was once in the back of the position, the last few shots, the more stable, only the backward champion 0.2 ring achievements won the silver.
This year, the 27-year-old Zhang Binbin, during his 16-year shooting career, had nearly passed the hard-won silver medal several times.
Her mother, Ms. Zhang, told reporters that when they hesitated, Zhang Binbin looked for a few "small lobbyists" in the same village.
These "small lobbyists" were the same village kids who had been recommended for training at the same time, including Zhang Binbin's cousin.
Shortly after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin, once again because of family difficulties, took the initiative to go back to Shangan's school.
But after his enlightenment coach Zhang Yajie repeatedly did the work, Zhang Binbin returned to the Xiamen team.
After entering the provincial team, Zhang Binbin had been late for the national team, once again because he couldn't see the hope and returned home again.
This time, not only the Zhang Yajie coach, the Xiamen shooting archery center and the Fujian Province team leaders and coaches came to the home, finally persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team.
Just like yesterday's match, the Xiamen girl's insistence on the road of shooting has been reversed one by one.
"The way each coach chooses the players is not the same, when I saw that Binbin's hand was very beautiful, and I was in the middle of it. "
Zhang Donghong also recalls that during the training test, her daughter did not have the best grades, but the number of rings was stable, and that was one of the important reasons Zhang Binbin attracted the coach.
In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie was most impressed by the input of the peasant girl.
He recalled that Zhang Binbin entered the Xiamen shooting team more than a year later, the team carried out the long-lasting gun training, asked the players to be unable to move for half an hour.
Ms. Zhang told reporters that her daughter had been a quiet and clever child, who had been fond of painting and homemade hand-made toys since childhood.
"It turns out I'm going to do clothes and sewing clothes at home, and Binbin will pick up some pieces to make a doll. "
She says her daughter often makes hand-made toys, and she is good at drawing, from the five officials of the doll to the dress, which can always be very lifelike.
As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and his family gather less, only the holidays can go home, usually rely on telephone contact.
Parents say that whether they meet or call, Zhang Binbin rarely says his hard work, more is to talk to his parents about happy things.
When I can't see my daughter, my parents store their daughter's paintings at home, as well as the honors of the calendar year.
Zhang Xiao has shown her daughter's cartoon to reporters, "if not as a shooting athlete, she should continue to draw."
In the living room of Zhang 's second floor, there was a cupboard full of medals, medals and certificates she had received.
Zhang Donghong put the medals and medals in order, and the certificate was unified into the folder. "These are the honor of Binbin over a dozen years of work, and we all cherish it."
In recent days, the charity fund in Hebei Province sent 16,000 yuan to six families in Jingxing, Taitai, Guiquan and other villages in Jingxing County, where they lost their families.
This is another outpouring of sympathy and care that the Fund has sent to society to look for "young children and lonely old people who have lost their lives in the 7.19 flood".
The heavy rain caused floods in Hebei Province, causing flooding in some parts of the Province, as well as deaths and disappearances.
Good people "old iron" to help the community to drain the unfortunate sacrifice, leaving a 2-year-old child and a pregnant wife, good people "old iron" touching story moved the entire provincial capital.
On August 4, Hebei Province benevolence fund staff and Hebei Brand volunteers came to the good "old iron" home and handed the 3,200 yuan love into the hands of the "old iron" family.
When Mr Ye, the vice president of brands, learned about the status of the "old iron" family, he immediately decided to launch a "charity sale" in the company's corporate members to help the "old iron" family to spend time with them.
Hebei Province charitable foundation, the full name of the voluntary service foundation of Hebei Province, which was launched by the Hebei Brand Association Preparatory Committee, was established in August 2015.
According to the Hong Kong Oriental Daily, the sale of diamonds in the Mainland is now referred to as three major problems, including the high sale price of virtual diamonds, the weight of false diamonds, and the lack of security after sale.
In Antwerp, one of the world's largest diamond trading centres, the local artisans' diamond cutting technology is all over the world, and the diamonds sold have been carefully identified and welcomed by women from the mainland.
"A small sack, held in the palm of the hand, a small band of light, worth nearly a million yuan, "an aunt Liu, who was involved in buying diamonds, told the mainland media about her experience in Antwerp this June.
She said she hid the diamonds in her underwear, went to the toilet for a few days, took a bath, and went to bed with a lot of tension.
She claim. that the purchase price of the diamonds bought in Antwerp is about fifty-five thousand yuan per carat, and the retail price of the same quality diamonds in Xiamen is about $111,000.
With the purchase price of the purchase price, she sold all the diamonds and made a huge profit of 200,000 yuan at a time.
According to the Mainland Customs, diamond non-passengers are in the category of goods or necessities in the course of their trips. They are subject to declaration at the time of entry and exit, or are listed as smuggling and are liable to imprisonment for serious offences.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will spend the summer vacation in Switzerland, but did not disclose the location of the holiday, according to media reports.
According to the media, after the British referendum took off, Britain's new prime minister opted for a "neutral" Swiss holiday on the continent, with some policy symbolism.
The symbolism of the Swiss neutral state has played a role in the choice of the British Prime Minister's first resort, the Guardian said.
The Daily Telegraph commented that Theresa May chose to take a vacation in Switzerland, which was the first time that a British Prime Minister had gone on holiday in Switzerland.
The choice of the two female prime ministers contrasts with Blair and Cameron's two male prime ministers who prefer to spend their holidays in warmer places.
Britain's new prime minister, Theresa May, is expected to return to London on August 24, after waiting for her to be a series of important work and activities.
The British parliament will resume on September 5, and the issue of the debate includes an online request for a second Brexit referendum.
The British referendum on June 23 decided to take off from Europe, but Britain's new prime minister was reluctant to launch paragraph 50 of the Lisbon treaty on the leave of Member States by the end of the year.

China's Mars program is coming
The mission of Mars exploration in China is to be surrounded, landed and inspected once, and this form has never been done abroad.
The goal of our Mars exploration launch is to take a step around, land, patrol, and this task is quite difficult.
Because Mars exploration takes 26 months to meet a time window, experts are working closely on a project to launch our first Mars probe by 2020.
According to Xu Dazhe, although our craft has entered deep space, the completion of the Mars exploration mission remains indispensable, and the exploration of Mars means that China is entering the era of deep space exploration in a real sense.
"Every two or three years, there is a recent opportunity for Mars to distance the earth, and to launch a Mars probe at this point in time is the most energy-saving for the launch vehicle. "
"Considering the quality of the Mars probe, the launch mission will be carried out by our Long March 5 launch vehicle, "he said.
Our Mars reconnaissance mission is to be surrounded, landed and inspected once, in a form that has never been done abroad, and it has been proposed to orbit and land once in a foreign country, but the landing failed.
There are many technical areas involved in the exploration of Mars, especially if the rover is a space probe, but it has a distinctive feature compared with the general space detector.
That is to say, the Mars probe should have the ability to determine the driving route and the risk of finding obstacles.
'the reason humans are so keen on Mars is because the exploration of Mars has important scientific, technological and other implications, even for the future of mankind,' said Pang Zhihao, a researcher at the China space science and technology group's five college.
Mars has now become the planet with the highest level of human research except the earth, and the history of humans using space probes for Mars exploration runs through almost the entire history of human space.
As a result, mankind hopes to build a living base on Mars one day and eventually emigrate to Mars, turning it into a second home for mankind.
There are plenty of signs that Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth, only after billions of years of evolution into thin atmosphere, low temperatures and depletion of water sources.
As a result, the exploration or manned landing of Mars could provide a plan for preventing the earth from becoming the second Mars that humans could not survive.
As of June 2016, a total of 114 lunar exploration and 43 Mars exploration have been carried out worldwide.
However, from the 1990 's to the present, humans have conducted 18 missions to Mars, and the lunar exploration has been conducted only 14 times.
There are currently five Mars orbiter and 2 Mars Rover working, but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are working.
The world's space powers have developed a detection plan aimed at the Mars system, which shows that today's Mars exploration is hotter than the moon.
On November 5, 2013, India launched its first Mars probe, Mangarian, to become the first country in Asia to successfully detect Mars.
"Mangarian" is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars, and to explore whether there are signs of methane and life on Mars.
The hardest part of the mission was that the probe entered the Martian atmosphere with only one opportunity to slow down its aerodynamic shape and parachute
The Mars exploration mission faces many technical challenges, according to Sun Zhezhou, chief designer of the Mars probe, the main body of the five chambers of China Aerospace Science and Technology Group.
The atmospheric pressure on Mars is very low, and only 1% with atmospheric pressure on the surface of the earth has a high degree of uncertainty.
Scientists do not yet have a thorough understanding of the factors such as its changes and the characteristics of the storm.
Mars, which often forms a dust storm similar to the Earth's dust weather in the summer, will lead to a sharp drop in solar energy received by the rover, and it is necessary to design a "hibernation" model for the rover, allowing it to wait patiently for dust storms to pass.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a cutting effect on the sun's rays, which poses a problem for the energy supply of the Mars exploration.
This requires the probe's solar wing to be larger, and it needs to be constantly adjusted to aim in the direction of the sun.
Also, Mars's surface gravity is only the 38% of the earth, but it is much larger than the surface of the moon, so the probe needs greater power.
"The most central and difficult part of the Mars exploration mission is the process of the spacecraft's aerodynamic shape and parachute slowing into the Martian atmosphere, with only one opportunity to ensure success. "
'because the Earth is far away from Mars, the entire process cannot be controlled by the ground in real time, so it has to be done independently by the probe,' says Sun Zhezhou.
There is not so much propellant to offset that high speed, so when landing on Mars, the deceleration depends on the Martian atmosphere, but the Martian atmosphere is difficult to simulate on the ground.
In general, the way to detect Mars is similar to that of detecting the moon, "Pang Zhihao said." It is also a "detour, fall, patrol, return" and finally achieve the goal of a manned landing on Mars.
Since Mars is much farther away from the Earth than the moon, the exploration of Mars needs to overcome a series of more complex technical difficulties.
According to Taiwanese media, the "chief executive" Lin Quan announced yesterday morning that the "regulations on the improper acquisition of property by political parties and their accompanying organizations" came into effect today.
The vice chairman of the Kuomintang, Zhan Qixian, said the "one-hundred-year-old Kuomintang, with the commitment and responsibility of society, will not fail in this way."
Lin Quan stresses that, if a political party, an accompanying organization or trustee is in violation of the prohibitions imposed by the regulations, the Committee will investigate and punish and punish it in accordance with its mandate.
Lin Quan also announced that the Vice-Chairman of the improper party production Committee would be headed by Hong Bagen, the deputy director of the Agency.
He said that it would be no choice for Gu Lixiong to sit as Chairman of the Party Committee, and to use Hong Bagen to check the experience of major cases in the past, which would serve as the basis for the Commission's inventory of cases related to improper party production.
Zhan Qixian believes that today, as long as there is a party, no one will give you social donations, and if the party's production is confiscated, the Kuomintang can just ask for social support and sponsorship. "It really doesn't have a chance to go today."
The Zhan Qixian also stressed that, even after the party's regulations were on the road, the KMT had not been completely confiscated and confiscated, and the rest would continue to donate as promised, allowing the party to go to zero, and the party wanted everything to start from scratch.
The original title: "Corridor doctor" Lan Yue Feng v. CCTV host Wang zhiann's reputation for infringement of first instance lost
The state-of-the-art evening news is due to the announcement of the "corridor doctor" by the CCTV host Wang zhiann on Sina Weibo, which will be appealed to the court by Wang zhiann and Beijing micro-dream innovation network technology Co. Ltd.
Yesterday afternoon, Haidian court held a judgment on the case, which ruled that Wang zhi-ann and the micro-dream company did not constitute a violation, and rejected all requests for litigation from lanyue Feng.
At the beginning of 2014, CCTV reporter Wang Zhixin found that despite the fact that a more than 600 day in the hospital corridor was portrayed by the media as a tragic hero to be suppressed by the system, there was a lot of misinformation about the reports.
On March 29, 2014, the CCTV news survey produced the "corridor doctor" programme broadcast.
There is no evidence to support the various so-called over-medical information reported to the media by lanyue Feng.
Wang zhiann, also in the -certified micro-blog, described the "lanyue Feng's move to this step is character, it has obvious paranoid personality, and so on."
Lanyue Feng asked Wang zhiann to delete micro-blog, apologize to him and compensate for the mental damage 100,000 yuan.
During the court hearing at that time, the two sides held a debate on whether Wang zhiann violated the reputation of lanyue Feng.
A: the Chinese team is very busy at the start of the track and field. They are looking forward to breaking through the four-bike
The bicycle is expected to achieve a "zero breakthrough" in the Olympic gold medal, while a women's girl will challenge two World Champions Germany and expect an upset to hit the top four.
Wang Zhen has played a prominent role in the last two seasons, with a silver medal in Beijing's athletics world championships last year, and an upgrade of the individual project champion at the group race race in May.
According to foreign media, the 27-year-old Korean archery actress Zhang Huizhe won the gold medal in the women's archery individual competition, after the team won a gold medal in the Olympic Games.
Zhang Huizhe is thought to be a late runner, who regrets not getting tickets to the last London Olympics and is now proudly standing on the top podium of the Rio Olympics.
Zhang Huizhe won the gold medal with a total score of 6-2 beating Germany's Lisa Onou at the women's archery individual final at the Rio Samba road stadium in Brazil.
She first shot at the fourth grade of elementary school until the 27-year-old won the first individual gold medal in the World Cup in 2014, and was a late runner.
"There was no level before middle school so that we could not compete in the national competition, "he recalls.
Zhang Huizhe, who won only fourth in the London Olympics four years ago, lost the Olympic tickets, only to watch his colleague and friend Chifu Bai win two gold medals.
At the end of the women's archery individual awards ceremony, Zhang Huizhe spoke of her speech, "until finally, as soon as possible, archery, may be the result of a good result, satisfied.
The 28 year old Korean archery "one sister", the London Olympic archery individual gold medal winner Chifu Bai won a bronze medal.
Chifu Bai lost to the Zhang Huizhe in the semifinals, competing with Mexico's Alejandra Valencia for a bronze medal.
Chifu Bai in ensuring the bronze after the tear on the field, during the silence to bear the burden of the gold burden can be imagined.
The first is that the coaching staff have accumulated rich experience in constant research, followed by scientific training, which need to be accumulated over a long period of time.
The archer team in military training, night through the cemetery, and other methods to help the team focus and maintain a normal sense of mind.
Despite the fact that it has not yet been confirmed, many sources say that Apple is coming in September, when it will be held in September.
Apple has not responded, but the function and configuration of the new iPhone has been released, even with images of the iPhone7 "machine model" on the Internet.
If you want to buy the products for the first time, you must choose a good channel, for example, Suning.
This has added to the disappointment of the new mobile phone, "it has lengthened, but can't cast a hologram! This generation of iPhones is terrible."
IPhone7, like any other iPhone, has been accompanied by countless secrets before birth.
In addition, several sources claim that the new iPhone will cancel the 3.5 mm headphone interface and switch to a Bluetooth connection and a charging interface, which will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker.
Another evidence to support this message is that as early as 2014, Apple allowed the headphone manufacturer to produce an earphone product connected by a charging interface.
These messages, or true or false, will not be known until the Apple in the autumn of 2016.
But this does not prevent the industry from looking at the prospect of iPhone7, which many believe is likely to become Apple's last big upgrade to the iPhone series.
The iPhone's market share has declined, according to data released by IDC, a recent market research firm.
Among them, Goldman maintained a "buy" rating for Apple's shares, while BMO analysts thought iPhone7 would reap a historic sales record.
At the same time, Botong's CEO, Hock Tan, said Apple's future revenue growth would likely exceed 20%, thanks entirely to the launch of the iPhone7.
The 7% respondents said they had plans to buy iPhone7, compared with the 4% that planned to buy iPhone6 two years ago.
It is understood that the current user group holding iPhone6 or 6Plus has 20% plans to buy iPhone7, which is a fairly high proportion.
Second, with expert analysis, most Apple fans like to replace their iPhone by the next generation.
According to statistics, of all the iPhone users, some 26% users have not changed their mobile phones for two years, and the iPhone has been used for two years for almost 120 million users.
According to the media, Taiwan suffered several earthquakes during the iPhone7 production, "the destruction of TSMC's production facilities was beyond imagination and could have an impact on the early iPhone7 supply," he said.
The contradiction between supply and demand can affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time at a low price to start the real iPhone7.
Suning has seen frequent meetings with Apple in the near future to prepare enough supplies, according to people familiar with the matter.
The operator has already talked with Suning, it is foreseeable that with the deep cooperation between the two sides, it will inevitably bring lower prices and more intimate services for the users.
"At the lowest price, consumers are likely to be able to buy iPhone7 for just seven yuan a day. "
Ample supply and a variety of preferences, let the purchase of iPhone7 no longer "pressure mountain big", and Suning's logistics, more will turn this beautiful into a more intuitive experience.
Maybe, you'll get a call in the middle of the night, "Hello, Su Ning , your iPhone7 has arrived."
The organizers hope to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the two countries through heritage exhibitions, which will enable local people to learn more about the long history of Chinese culture.
The "heritage exhibition of the Ming Dynasty" in Barcelona is part of a tour of Europe and will continue until the beginning of October.
China bank and SPDB yesterday released the 2016 semi-annual report, and in the second quarter of the second quarter, gold returned to hold its shares again.
Among them, Mr Kim added to the Chinese bank 29.2931 million shares, which, by the end of June, had increased its stake in the Chinese Bank to 387 million shares, and the share of its shares had risen from 3.35% to 3.62%.
On the other hand, according to the calculation of China Merchants Securities, in the second quarter, Mr Jin added to the 38 million shares, holding its shares to nearly 600 million shares, and the proportion of shares in that bank was 2.77%.
Recently, the Hobo garden of the lion creek in City, Zhejiang Province, is officially open to villagers and tourists.

According to the international media, the "green pool" of the Rio Olympic Games has attracted the attention of the outside world as a result of the water from blue to green in the diving pool.
However, in the morning of October 10, the water polo pool adjacent to the diving pool turned green.
The Australian water polo player said after the match that he had a stabbing pain in his eyes, trying to shed tears.
In the past, officials of the Rio Olympic Games confirmed the warming of the pool and said the water discoloration was due to the weakening of alkalinity and does not affect the health of the athletes.
But Australian athletes, after winning a match with the Japanese team in a water polo pool, said they had a stabbing pain in their eyes.
When the water became green in the diving pool, the organizers worked overtime at 9 pm to deal with the diving pool, but it was found that the color of the water polo pool changed rapidly on the morning of 10.
During the Australian and Japanese games, the environmental conditions of the water polo pool deteriorated gradually, but officials stressed that they would restore the water quality to their original colors on the 11th day.
"Yesterday afternoon, the level of water in the diving pool became weaker first, "said Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the Rio Games.
"We have learned a range of causes that could trigger the discoloration of the pool and the alkalinity of the water. "
The water sports center conducted a series of tests on water quality, and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the pool to determine the quality of water quality.
"We have been going through normal procedures these days, but we may have overlooked how many athletes are likely to have an impact on the quality of water. "
"But changes in the color of the water will certainly have no effect on the health of the body, especially the athletes. "
"The independent team confirmed our assessment and confirmed the steps we have taken to restore the pool to normal colors and normal chemical conditions. "
"We had hoped that the pool would return to normal in the morning, but the pace of recovery was affected by the rain. "

"We have been conducting a continuous inspection of the market and regulating the activities of travel agencies to ensure the safety of tourists, "he said.
On the morning of August 12, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016.
According to Sheng Laiyun, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics and director of the comprehensive Statistics Division of the national economy, the growth of some indicators in the national economy slowed in July but is still operating in a reasonable range.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that data on fixed-asset investment growth, total imports, etc., fell in July.
'with regard to the state of the national economy in July, I would like to borrow a phrase that the prime minister once said was "volatile and still good ", which would provide a better overview of the characteristics of the July economic operation.
He explained that "volatility" means that the growth rate of some economic indicators in July was indeed a drop.
Because the economy at home and abroad is still in deep adjustment in July, the international situation is complex and changeable, and the recovery of the world economy is less than expected, so export pressure is still relatively large.
In the domestic context, the economy is still at a critical stage of adjustment, and the pain of adjustment is being released, and the economy is facing modest downward pressure, so some of the indicators are somewhat volatile.
Sheng Laiyun pointed out that in July there was a special situation in which floods were more severe, and high-temperature and hot weather had some impact on production operations in some areas.
According to a recent report released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 6,000 million people in the country were affected, with direct economic losses exceeding 200 billion yuan.
In terms of industrial, investment and transport related indicators, these regions are affected to varying degrees.
Cargo turnover increased by 3.6 percentage points in July compared with last month, and floods have had a definite impact on traffic in these areas.
From these factors, the volatility of some of the indicators in July is also normal, as well as expected.
"The potential is still good, "he said, referring to the fact that, despite the decline in economic growth, the overall stability of the economy was stable and there was no change in the trend towards good stability.
In July, the CPI rose 1.8%, rising 0.2%; in January - July CPI rose 2.1%, so the price situation was generally stable.
According to the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau portal to the district County high temperature weather statistics, in addition to the unitary Yang, the rest of our city can receive a different degree of high temperature allowance.
Currently, there are at least 28 provinces in the country with clear criteria for the granting of allowances, although the standards are not the same in the provinces, while Chongqing is receiving a high temperature allowance in the form of a high-temperature working day allowance.
Those under 37 ℃ above 37 ℃ shall be issued at a rate of not less than 10 yuan per person per day; at more than 37 ℃, they shall be issued at a rate of not less than 15 yuan per person per day.
A maximum of 20 yuan per month for high-temperature staff at or above 40 ℃ (except for workers who have already enjoyed a high temperature job allowance in accordance with the law).
According to this standard, the state with the largest number of days of high-temperature weather last month received 330 yuan and the lowest number of days was 80 yuan, while the highest temperature of the unitary Yang did not meet the high temperature standard, so there was no high temperature allowance.
In the past, a number of units will use cool drinks to offset the high temperature allowance, the city safety Bureau said that this kind of behavior is not in accordance with the current method.
The employing unit shall not deduct or reduce the wages of labourers as a result of the suspension of work in high-temperature weather and the shortening of working hours.
The City Council said employees who did not receive a high temperature allowance at high temperatures could seek legal rights through the labour dispute mediation agency where the business is located, or call the 12,333 to complain.
If the employing unit refuses to issue a high temperature allowance, the worker may lodge a complaint with the competent department of human resources social security at or above the county level where the employment is located.
At the same time, because the high temperature allowance is part of the wage, it is not a benefit, it should be included in the total wages, the deduction of tax.
As a result, the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage and must be issued in cash and cannot be replaced in kind, such as drinks.
The newly built Urumqi station is located in the high-speed rail area of Urumqi, and the entire building area is about 100,000 square meters.
The ground 1 and 2 floors are for the station, the waiting room and office and commercial premises, and the first floor is the station floor.
At present, Urumqi station is the largest integrated transport hub in Xinjiang, which integrates high-speed rail, rail transportation, public transportation and rental, and can achieve seamless docking of various transfer modes.
A total of 3 ticket offices are located on both sides of the platform and on the north side of the platform, with 39 artificial ticketing windows and 34 automatic ticket vending machines.
In the case of check-in, there are 30 channels on both sides of the waiting hall, and passengers can check and wait on the ticket barrier number on the ticket.
If you need help, you can get a timely service if you choose the 41 call buttons that are set in the mobile station.
From July 1, the old passenger station, also the passenger train from Urumqi South Station, took a step by step to Urumqi station.
That is to say, all cars and 30-to-exit trains can stop at Urumqi.
Now both stations can buy tickets, and the trains between them are around 10 minutes, and passengers need to pay attention to the name of the destination and the terminal.
The official operation of the new railway station in Urumqi will become an important platform for Xinjiang to build a comprehensive national transportation city and promote the "Silk Road Economic belt" and the construction of new areas.
Gracia is a budding female big mouth bird with the smell of tropical rain forests.
In the Central American country, Costa Rica, the giant mouth bird Gracia and its story have long been known.
At a news conference on August 10, the post-operative Gracia finally appeared to show people its brand-new 3D printed plastic beak.
It was a one-and-a-half year ago when someone broke his beak and was dying of a giant beak, and now it's a new life.
This day not only proclaims that it has returned to health, but it has moved into a luxury aviary, a day of meeting with the human friends who care about it.
The Gracia, who entered the new home, was slightly shy, but soon became lively, rolling in the basin, and eating grapes with a new beak.
In order to remind people of the damage it had suffered, the technicians did not paint its new beak, but retained the original white of 3D printing materials.
The beak is a thin layer of cuticle, empty inside, with only a few thin bone support bars in a staggered arrangement.
In spite of this internal reinforcement, the beak of a giant beak is still fragile and can be broken when hurt.
The animal rescue center, ornithologists and a US 3D print company worked together to produce a number of "test beaks" for Gracia and finally made the perfect beak for it.
Now Gracia has been able to use the new beak to drink water, eat, and even peck up small grains.
"The final product is designed for about two months and it takes only four or five hours to print it out. "
"3D printing is not the technology of the future, it has really come into your life," said Tomas Langer, Chairman of the US SG3D printing company, in an interview with Xinhua International reporter.
In January 2015, a farm in Gracia, a Alajuela Province in central Costa Rica, was found in the blood of a giant mouth bird Gracia.
At that time, its beak was brutally broken by a gang of young people, and it was completely unable to eat, and life was in danger.
The horror of the Gracia, after media coverage, caused a tidal wave of opposition to cruelty to animals both inside and outside Costa Rica.
There was a demand for stricter animal protection laws and increased penalties for abusers.
People spontaneously come and do their best to help Gracia recover as much as possible before the injury.
Even 3D printing technology inventor Chuck Hull has also been involved in the design of the Gracia's beak.
"The Gracia is very special and its upper beak is less than 1 cm in the rest, so it brings a lot of difficulties to the installation of the new beak. "
"We scan the Gracia first and then design and produce an extension that is slightly longer than the rest of its beak, fixed on its upper beak with glue. "
"This reduces the risk of further invasive damage to Gracia, "Langer told Xinhua International reporter.
Before installing the prosthesis, the staff will clean up the beak for the Gracia every day to prevent infection.
A thousand miles away, the story of the giant mouth-bird Gracia moved the famous documentary director Paula Eredia and the discovery news channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded the details of Gracia's installation of the new beak, recording a documentary, "the kingdom of the big mouth bird," which was broadcast on the Animal Planet Channel this month.
The documentary "the kingdom of big mouth birds" shows how a small bird can change a country, and how to involve its citizens in the fight against cruelty to animals.
Core Tip: Japanese oil companies, in particular, are wary of the rise of China's small independent oil refinery, known as the "teapot".
Japan's biggest oil company, JX Energy, says "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the downturn," the media said on August 12.
Japanese oil companies, in particular, are wary of the rise of China's small independent oil refinery, known as the "teapot".
The quality of China's oil products is gradually approaching Japan's oil products as a result of the Chinese government's tightening of environmental regulations.
Before obtaining an import license for crude oil, the "teapot refinery" has generally been refined from oil, such as Russia, with a high sulphur content.
The sulfur content of petroleum products produced is high, the oil is poor, and become one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining permission to import crude oil, the "teapot refinery" has been able to import crude oil and Russian crude oil with lower sulphur content, and the quality of its petroleum products has also risen.
"As the quality standards for oil products in China have continued to improve, the capacity of refining equipment has also risen, "said dongburning General oil company.
As a result, the quality of oil products exported by China has gradually reached the same level as that of Japan, the world's highest quality.
"After the end of 2015, China has started exporting high-quality light oil to Australia, "says JX Energy, competing with Japanese products in the Asian market.
Although "Japan's high-quality oil" is facing a crisis, Japan's oil companies are responding only to "paying attention to the market and exporting to the profitable areas at the same time."
As China's exports of petroleum products have had a huge impact on the Asian market, more attention has been paid to the teapot refineries.

Ultraviolet light not only causes the children's skin to become black, will burn the skin more, how to allow the skin to pass the military training smoothly, do not get sunburn?
The sunscreen is generally marked with SPF and PA, and SPF refers to the sun protection index, which is aimed at UVB ultraviolet, and our common SPF index is 15, 30, 50, and so on.
The products with PA are aimed at UVA, so that sunscreen will play a more effective role, in general, the strength of PA is expressed by + and more than one + represents an extended period of effective protection.
Oily skin should choose a more penetrating Water-based sunscreen products, sun protection spray is also a good choice.
Dr skin should choose -like sunscreen products; neutral skin is generally not strictly prescribed, sensitive skin to wipe any skin care is a burden, recommends the selection of pure physical sunscreen products.
Remember to apply sunscreen half an hour in advance, because sunscreen will take time to fully penetrate the skin.
Military training day is longer, the sunscreen can be cleaned every two hours to have a lasting effect, don't be lazy.
Because the skin has just been stimulated by the sun, military training comes back don't use whitening products immediately.

Farmers who buy farm machinery during the exhibition continue to carry out the cumulative subsidy policy, and farmers buy farm machinery with the highest amount of subsidy from the 40%.
This exhibition is aimed at the global merchants, especially to increase the invitation to the countries and target market countries along the "Belt along the way".

The "Xiang fair" has become an important platform for the development of local specialty industries and the promotion of specialty industries to go out of the country.
On some nights, the ionosphere is full of free electrons, which means that radio signals can go farther.
The United States Air Force is interested in replicating this effect, according to the American Journal of mass science on August 11.
Although a stable mass of free electrons can help people listen to the radio on the edge of a university radio station, this may not be the interest of the US air force.
The electronic ionosphere means that the radio, used by the military, has a wider range of transmissions, and it may provide some protection for the global positioning system (GPS) signal to protect it from solar storms.
The ultimate goal may be to create a series of cube satellites, based on demand, which can strengthen the ionosphere when needed.
But first of all, the team that signed the contract with the air force must prove that the scientific principles would work.
Industry data show that the total capacity for coal production in 2015 is close to 6 billion tonnes, and that the country's coal production capacity is an excess of 1.8 billion tons.
Over the past decade, the State Council has issued five notifications of phasing out surplus and backward capacity.
Although the first four times did not target the coal industry, the target industry was directly associated with the coal industry.
From November last year to January this year, Qinhuangdao 5,500 -powered coal prices hovered over the 370 yuan for a long time, and 90% of coal companies fell into a loss.
Coal prices have recovered steadily since February, and recently the price of coal-fired coal is up four weeks, rising to a 16-month high, climbing to 436 yuan per ton, up nearly 70 yuan from the start of the year.
As the price picks up, all circles worry about it: Will a batch of small coal mines resume production?
In this regard, the director of the China (Hainan) Institute for reform and development, Kwan, carried out an analysis and interpretation.
K wan: It is a matter of high concern for all parties to go to production capacity, and the list of results released today by the coal industry does make everyone feel more worried.
These three surface factors also reflect the relative lag in the transformation of our pattern of growth in the past, which has not yet been fundamentally transformed by government-led growth.
Second, this is directly related to the push of local governments, and in the process of production capacity, the funds and corresponding supporting measures are in place, and in this regard, the differences in different regions are indeed larger.
Third, if some of the provinces that are currently in slower progress are to catch up in the second half of the year, they may face a greater risk.
In this case, the process of relying on central prize replenishment to advance capacity is likely to have a negative impact.
First, the ability to go to capacity is not simply to carry out total volume control.
Our aim is to restructure the entire coal industry by eliminating backward production capacity and pushing forward the optimization of the structure.
In the process of deploying capacity, local governments must combine the transformation and upgrading of production capacity and the coal industry to develop relevant services.
Second, we need to give full play to the power of administrative oversight and administrative supervision if we want to complete this year's production capacity this year.
Finally, we need to strengthen the supporting role of social security.
Because the market is directly related to the problem of employment, we need to strengthen employment skills training for employees and workers.
"The reason for the decline is that foreign investment has worsened expectations of Brazil's GDP growth in the medium term. "
In 2015, Brazil's participation in global direct investment was 3.7%, down from 5.7% in 2014.
Credit Suisse's International Investment Attractiveness Index consists of four sub-indices: Infrastructure, economic prospects, business environment and direct investment.
In 2015, Brazil's international direct investment was $64.6 billion, down from $731 billion in 2014.
Last year, the "Greenfield Investment " in Brazil (the investment model for foreign investment plants) was $17.9 billion, a year-on-year reduction of 2.1%.
"There are a total of 288 'Greenfield investment' projects in Brazil, compared with the annual average of 314 from 2003 to 2014.
However, in the first half of 2016, international direct investment in Brazil had reached $33.8 billion, an increase of almost 10% compared with the same period last year.
Canadian police kill IS supporters: A home-made bomb is nearing the end of its preparations for a busy city
The taxi company said the taxi was dispatched to the Dreephod home before the police arrived.
In a news conference Wednesday, Canadian police said police received information from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about the "martyrdom video" that the young man was going to attack.
A man wearing a black Balakla hat on the screen, according to the German voice, was reading the Koran, referring to crimes against Muslims, and vowed to launch an attack on a city in Canada soon.

After the upgrade, the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal extension channel old Wan Fu River, the Hatano channel to collect tolls on September 1.
These two tributary channels take the form of social financing for reform and construction, and the fees have been approved by the relevant provincial government departments.
The old Wanfu River channel flows through the golden Township, the fish platform, and through the Nanyang Lake into the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, with a total length of 32.5 km.
According to the requirement of navigation, the old Wanfu River channel adopts the method of conservation reform, the local water depth is , the local curve is cut straight and so on, the navigable conditions can be improved.
The channel flows through Jinxiang County, Ren Cheng district and via Nanyang Lake into the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, with a total length of 19 km.
The renovation of the two waterways began in February 2011, with the completion of acceptance and acceptance in January 2015, and investment construction and operation subject to the An Ping Canal Logistics Service Centre in Jining.
In accordance with the principle of "loan construction and fee repayment", the An Ping Canal Logistics Service Center in Jining, based on the fee standard approved by the price Bureau of Shandong Province, collects tolls on the waterway.
Among them, the base toll will be collected at 1.75 yuan per ton, and the mileage will be collected at $0.05 per ton.
The collection of tolls will take effect from 15 June 2016 until 14 June 2019.
The reporter has learned from the port Bureau of Jining that there are four toll lanes in Jining, respectively, the river channel, the white horse river channel, the Hatano channel, and the old Wanfu River channel.
The channel is the tributary channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, which takes the form of social financing to upgrade.
The water river waterway upgrading project is the first to adopt the "government + market" model for the construction of the infrastructure construction in inland waterway of Shandong Province, the government accounts for the main investment, the social fund supplementary funding gap.
The white horse River, the old Wanfu River, the Hatano River and other feeder routes take the form of pure market-oriented operation.
The funds allocated by the State cannot meet the needs of the construction of the project and restrict the progress of the upgrading of the waterway.
The use of social funds for the construction of public infrastructure is in line with the requirements of the State policy, as well as the way to unlock the financial bottleneck.
Ning Zetao's performance in the semi - finals of the 100 metre freestyle has left many Chinese audiences speechless.
But in the 50m freestyle heat, Ning Zetao once again refreshed people's "bottom line."
In fact, the 50m freestyle was not a Ning Zetao item, and his performance and best performance at the world championships in Kazan also determined that he was not likely to make a breakthrough in the project.
Sure enough, the biggest reason for Ning Zetao's failure was that he had lost his interest in swimming, according to the Hong Kong authoritative media, the big Gazette.
Many of the factors on the sidelines may have had a big impact on his thinking about the future, and he is now likely to be more interested in moving into the entertainment industry.
After the world championships in Kazan, Ning Zetao, with its ultra-high value and good grades, instantly became a net red.
As a result, names such as "national husband", "little meat" and "pretty boy" continue to be a label on his body.
All sorts of business activities come to us, the best of the money, and become a shining path of gold.
In this case, Ning Zetao even chose to retire at this time to join the entertainment industry, not only his freedom, but also a plausible path.
After all, he was only 23 years old, and after a certain degree of study, he could use his popularity to play one or two TV shows.
But Ning Zetao needs to see if he has enough qualifications compared to those of his predecessors?
At the Sydney Olympics in Sydney, the 21-year-old Liu Xuan has arrived at the end of an athlete's career.
Liu Xuan's beautiful appearance allows her to be remembered quickly, as well as laying the foundation for her future foray into the entertainment industry.
After retiring, Liu Xuan appeared in a number of TV dramas and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tian Liang took part in the double 10-meter race of the two Olympic Games and won two gold and two silver medals.
But after losing to teammate Hu Jia in the single 10-meter race in 2004, Tian Liang's competitive state came down and was expelled from the diving team.
And he and his daughter took part in a variety show, such as "where dad went", even to make him make enough of the eyeball.
Once the gymnastics gold generation Yang Wei, Li Li, and all high-profile participation in various variety shows.
It is worth mentioning that Yang Wei Li, who led China to win the 2008 Olympic men's championship, Yang Wei was twice the individual all-round gold medal, known as the all-around king.
And , while leading China to the 2012 Olympic team title, also became the king of the ring.
And after having suffered a miscarriage of gold at the London Olympics, Chen an ice generous move, also let him circle powder countless.
However, the main energy of these athletes is still in the field, and the variety show is just like -touch down.
But whether retired or active athletes, being able to get the favor of the entertainment industry will need to be able to get the results to be guaranteed.
After all, the athlete step into a new field, whether the ability or the network, is a blank state.
Even Tian Liang, Liu Xuan and the entertainment industry for many years "old people", ordinary viewers mention them, more still think of their performance at the Olympic Games.
But Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and other new people, in the variety show when the introduction, without exception is "Olympic champion."
Compared to the number of people above, the name of a swimming world champion in Ning Zetao is a little thin.
What's more, compared with the retirement of Tian Liang, Liu Xuan, Yang Wei and others, the negative impact of Ning Zetao on his image is probably incalculable if he is at the top of his 23-year-old career and a slight setback in his sports career.
After all, to mention the athletes, people's demands are "not invincible, but in spite of the difficulties", the Ning Zetao is far from this point.
Ten thousand steps to say, Ning Zetao is handsome, can rely entirely on Yan value to get the support of thousands of brain remnant powder.
Not a bit of skill, only on the exterior, want to be mixed up in the entertainment industry, this is not more difficult than a good training to recover the state of it.
The choice of the path of life depends on the individual's will, but how to choose, Ning Zetao should have a number.
On the surface, the network social platform expands the social network, reduces people's loneliness.
The scope of social networking is becoming more and more widespread, not only gradually replacing the traditional telephone contact, even infiltration into the real living circle, quietly changing the social life of the current people.
Online social benefits are obvious, such as convenient and quick, so it is particularly easy to be favored by younger groups.
College students in 57% spend more than five hours a day using their mobile phones for more than five hours a day, according to a survey of college students' social habits.
"Social networking has the characteristics of low cost, fast transmission speed and simultaneous communication, which is in line with the needs of contemporary college students. "
To expand relationships, to engage in a more equal dialogue and to avoid social concerns is the main reason for our deeper love of online conversation.
The couple who just entered the company love to communicate with their colleagues, "because it's not too familiar to get into the unit, it's a lot closer to the social platform," he said.
"I have not been in touch with my friends for some time because of some misunderstanding, and then a few words in a large group began to warm up again," he said.
It engineer Wu Yan is a deep network social lover, and most of his social life takes place on the line, and network contacts are more than double the number of friends around the line.
Wu Yan himself admits to being more "like a duck to water" on the Internet.
"You can reply to your friends when you are ready to do so, because there are plenty of time to fill the words, and the presentation will be clearer. "
"Hidden under the ID, you come to me to avoid face-to-face personal collisions, not only with room to maneuver, but to give each other more time and space to think and act. "
"People of different identities have the right and efficiency to speak the same way, and social concerns in real life seem to be eliminated in cyberspace. "
Wu Yan's friend Xiao Peng, however, feels that the Wu Yan in life is a " -free ."
Xiao Peng and Wu Yan met in a large group, because both were active speakers and soon became familiar with each other.
Xiao Peng thinks that the Wu Yan is completely different from the network, the words are boring, and he does not take the initiative to express his opinions, and turn over and over to say "ha, OK, yes," or "I want to check the internet."
Lingshui police are now involved in the investigation, and the Lingshui Transportation Department will also step up efforts to crack down on illegal operating vehicles.

On August 11, at 8: 00 a.m., Qilu Evening News reporter followed the "healthy China line" free clinic service group to the East port district West Lake town river ditch village.
The village is located in a remote area, about 24 km from the city, with more than 200 households in the village, and it is inconvenient for many middle-aged and middle-aged patients to go out to see a doctor because of economic, transportation and physical limitations.

On August 11, when a telephone interview had returned to Huang Yilin in Mianyang, Sichuan, she said: "It was so urgent that there was only one thought in my mind to save people!"
Huang Yilin is a student at the 2015 level of the great landscape garden College of south and south Lin.
Huang Yilin, who studied urban and rural planning, wanted to visit the Sichuan Langzhong to study the local architectural design, so a family went on a tour.
At about 10 a.m. On August 8, Huang Yilin's father was resting at the hotel, and the mother and daughter came out for a trip to the city of Langzhong.
Not far away, I suddenly saw a group of people shouting, out of curiosity to go up.
Seeing that the little boy was gone, the little girl was beating wildly in the water, showing only her little head on the river, and going down from time to time, as a child who had learned to swim in a hurry to save people.
After the launch, Huang Yilin, the height of 165 cm, found that it was not in the end!
Before looking calm on the surface of the water, underneath it is the torrent!
But she was desperate to swim to the little girl.
Huang Yilin said the river was muddy, swift, and less than five meters away, almost all of her strength.
She tried her best to push the little girl to the bank. "The slope was particularly slippery, and I was afraid that I had no strength to sink."
So Huang Yilin asked his mother for help, and heard her daughter's call for help, and the water-borne Yin was ready to go into the water rescue and was stopped by a nearby tourist.
On August 10, when Huang Yilin jumped the river to save people, Ms. Yin received a lot of sympathy and praise from relatives and friends, as well as the "accountability" of a number of friends and relatives.
I am really afraid to think of it now! To tell the truth, when the child is on the bank of the river fast, my heart is nearly broken when I ask for help.
Despite the danger, Ms. Yin said, she would still support her daughter's choice if she was again in that scene. She was proud of her daughter!
As a result of being forced, Huang Yilin rarely volunteered to go into the water after he learned to swim. "I didn't expect this skill to come in handy."
Huang Yilin is a recognized "bully" in the class and is ready to help others, according to Chen Yikui, a monitor in the Huang Yilin class.

The Siberian tiger is currently listed as an endangered species (EN) by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List of endangered species.
According to the Ministry of forestry of Jilin Province, the data of joint monitoring by China and Russia in 1998 showed that there were only 4 to 6 wild Siberian tigers in Jilin Province and 3 to 5 in the northeast.
According to Yu Changchun, the director of the conservation Department of Jilin Province, Jilin Province has been increasing the protection of wild animals in recent years, and the population of the Siberian tiger and northeast leopard is growing significantly in China, and the distribution area is expanding.
The latest monitoring data in 2015 showed that only 27 wild Siberian tigers were monitored in Jilin Province and 42 in the northeast.
As the flagship species of world wildlife conservation in the border region of China and Russia, the cooperation between China and Russia is of great significance to the population recovery and reproduction of wild Siberian tigers and leopards.
According to the Forestry Bureau of Jilin Province, the former Jilin Province has established a long-term stable cooperative exchange mechanism with Russia.
The forestry sector and animal protection organizations of China and Russia have once again reached a number of consensus on the international forum for the protection of tiger tigers in China in 2016, which ended on November 11.

As a leading cadre of party members, the ideal faith is lost, a serious violation of the Party's discipline, and the party's 18th Congress still does not converge, not accept hands, wind against the wind, the nature is bad, the plot is serious.
After the case, after a number of media reports, has become the focus case, the social impact is extremely bad.
After the occurrence of the case, the police detachment of the Haikou City Public Security Bureau attached great importance to the immediate organization of a team of a group of capable police to attack the investigation.
The police immediately ran the suspect on the Internet, took a variety of measures to deal with it and, by contacting the police in the field, were in favor of the whereabouts of the king's country.
Since the suspect had been dealt with by the public security organs repeatedly and repeatedly by the public security organs, he had a strong anti-reconnaissance capability, coupled with his long-term drug abuse, the frequent seizure of drug addiction and the difficulty of the trial.
Greenland sharks, also known as sleeping sharks, are widely distributed between Greenland and the North Atlantic waters around Iceland, reaching four to five metres in length when they are adults.
But their growth is extremely slow, sometimes about 1 cm long in a year, suggesting that the Greenland shark may have a life span of foreign ministers.
Traditional dating methods usually use animal calcification tissue, and some sharks can use fin ridges, but this calcification is very rare in Greenland sharks.
The new study, led by Julius Nelson, from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, turned to a year of radioactive carbon testing with the eye lens of the Greenland shark.
The method had previously been used to determine the age of whales, but it was the first time to determine the age of fish such as sharks.
Their analysis showed that the life expectancy of the biggest shark was 392 years, with an error of 120 years.
That is to say, the shark is at least 272 years old and is likely to reach a maximum of 512 years.
In addition, the female Greenland shark is said to be about 4 meters long enough to be mature enough to become an adult at least until the age of 156.
As a result, researchers wrote in the paper that Greenland sharks are known to be the oldest and longest-lived vertebrates in the world, surpassing the previous longevity champion right whale (211 years old).
Since the beginning of the year, the change has been remarkable, and the RMB exchange rate has remained basically stable, and has laid the foundation for promoting the internationalization of the renminbi.
Judging from the performance of the market, the two-way fluctuation of the RMB exchange rate has been evident in the past year, the exchange rate elasticity has increased, and the exchange rate is expected to be stable overall.
At the same time, the exchange rate of RMB against the US dollar over 100 points has repeatedly appeared, but the process goes up and down.
Last year, the last change in "8 11" was put into effect in 2005, with a significant appreciation of the renminbi against the US dollar over the past decade.
Since the introduction of the new exchange, the renminbi has changed the status of the previous appreciation, the value of the renminbi has depreciated by about 8% in a year.
On October 1, the International Monetary Fund will formally accept the renminbi as the currency of the SDR (special drawing rights) weight.
This week, China's General Administration of Customs released statistics showing that the total value of China's imports and exports in the first seven months of this year was 13.21 trillion yuan, down 3% from the same period last year.
In the month of July, the total value of China's imports and exports fell by only 0.9%, especially as exports grew by 2.9% on a year-on-year basis.
Experts believe that despite signs of stabilization in July's imports and exports, there should be no high expectations.
In July, the total value of China's imports and exports fell to 2.09 trillion yuan, a year-on-year decline of 0.9%.
Among them, the export of 1.22 trillion yuan, the growth of 2.9%; the import of 873 billion yuan, the decline of 5.7%; the trade surplus 342.8 billion yuan, the expansion of 34%.
Despite the year-on-year decline in the total value of imports and exports, export figures have increased, and this is the fifth consecutive month of growth since March.

According to members of the theft group, they went from the field to Shanghai by taking black taxis, and then got out of the car, each in a few hours to get into the car and leave Shanghai together.
In the course of the crime, criminal suspects often take a building as a unit, use the external wall to climb, pry off the anti-theft window fence way from top to bottom "sweep floor" theft.
A few days ago, the criminal suspect has been transferred by the Xuhui Public Security Bureau to the Xuhui District Prosecutor's Office to review the prosecution.
The police reminded the general public that when going out, it was important to lock up the doors and windows of the house, and for the choice of the -proof window, it was suggested that the public should choose the steel with more hard material.
In late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will travel to Kenya to attend the sixth African Development Conference, according to the Beijing News evening peak.
The African Development Conference was dominated by Japan, and the previous five meetings were held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, so the meeting would also be the first to move to Africa.
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials have said that local meetings in Africa have helped to draw the attention of African and European countries to Japan.
In response to Mr Abe's trip, Kyodo news agency said the LDP would send parliamentarians to the countries concerned.
It is no coincidence that Japan 's "constant " path began in the early 1990s, and the African Development Conference, which was launched by Japan, began in 1993.
Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations and is an important ticket to the United Nations, and Japan wants to "get into it" and how can it abandon Africa?
There will also be an exchange of views with people from all countries on the extremist organization "Islamic State" and terrorist activities.
The "Western Group" will visit seven countries such as Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau.
Japan's Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida has also recently explained the intentions of the African Development Conference at the UN Security Council.
In the meantime, Abe announced that, for the sake of stability in sub-Saharan African countries, the amount of the 100 billion yen (about $6.1 billion) would be provided within five years.
Observers generally believe that Japan's generosity to Africa has been primarily for two purposes: To increase Japan 's presence in Africa; and to win the support of African countries on the issue of entry.
"In terms of politics, Africa is relatively underdeveloped, but the number of countries is relatively high, so Japan has always regarded it as the so-called 'big ticket field', "said Yang Bojiang analysis, an expert on Japan.
Japan will not give up in the future, and the work on Africa will not end in this way, and it will continue to strengthen.
The economy, because Japan has a relatively strong productive capacity, has a relatively limited domestic market, especially in the context of an aging population, where domestic demand is relatively low.
However, from Junichiro Koizumi, a decade ago, to Abe, a decade later, Japan has repeatedly launched a "sprint" that has been defeated.
The Japanese expert Yang Bojiang believes that Japan's frequent intentions are clear, but it is bound to be difficult to get into the usual path.
Japan wants to achieve its goals, first and foremost, to do well with its neighboring countries, in which Japan needs to have a correct attitude, whether in geopolitical rivalry or in ethnic disputes and historical awareness.

Liu Cigui went to Sanya to study "double repair and twin cities" to raise the level of urban construction
On the morning of December 12, the Liu Cigui hosted a symposium and heard a report on the implementation of the pilot work of the "twin cities" of the city of Sanya and the suggestions of the various departments concerned.
Liu Cigui gives full recognition to the milestones achieved in the pilot work and the good experiences and good practices that have been created.
Liu Cigui stressed that Sanya should seize the opportunity of historical development and take the "twin cities" pilot work as an important tool to give full play to the leading role of demonstration in the economic and social development of the province.
We should play a leading role in promoting the internationalization of the international tourism island, starting with a bit of detail, enriching international elements and creating international boutique.
We should play a leading role in urban and rural integration and global tourism, speed up the construction of special style towns, integrate tourism elements into each project, and build every village and town in Sanya into tourist attractions.
We should play a leading role in "the 100-day campaign for social investment in services", promote a number of major projects and parks, ensure the landing of high-quality projects and implement the requirements of big actions.
Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee, Sanya Municipal Party Secretary Zhang Qi, deputy governor Wang Lu, the provincial government Secretary-General Lu Zhiyuan participated in the research and discussion.
Deng Yaping, who has won 18 world championships in 14 years of sports, became the first person to win four Olympic gold medals in the history of China's Olympic Games.
She kept the world first in table tennis for eight consecutive years, and was the longest female athlete in the world's first time in the history of table tennis.
On September 26, 2010, the Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Daily and the General Manager of the People's Search Network Corporation, a cadre of the Department.
Recently, she will work with Yu Minhong to create the country's first sports industry innovation and entrepreneurship platform.
There is also a group of star coaches in China's sports: They have had an unlimited time in the athletes' era and have won countless glory for the country; after retirement, they have taught them many years of learning to win the championship.
As the first world champion of Chinese men's gymnastics, Huang Yubin chose to pick up the pointer after retiring.
From the women's team coach to the team coach, and then to the overall coach, Huang Yubin built a "Olympic gold regiment", the team won 9 gold 1 silver 4 bronze in the Beijing Olympic Games.
Since then, Tian Liang has been advertising endorsements continuously, more in recent years played a "cowboy", "Lei Feng" and other important roles.
Many NBA players have proved their strength, but there has been a decline in the number of people who have made progress.
Every season there will be a setback for some players, either because of an increase in age or the time limit for appearances.
Of course, some of the "setbacks" may be just the shrinkage of the data, and the players' strength may not fall.
Even though Wade is still one of the best scoring guards in the league, his performance in the bulls should not be as good as the heat.
He and Rondo have a limited range of , and the three-point shot of Captain Butler is only 32.8%, which puts them in a crowded place next season.
Coming to the windy city, the lightning man is bound to give the ball more to Butler and Rondo, and he is likely to play in the regular season.
The Okafor was awkward, and as the first choice for 76ers last season, he had to compete with Simons and Enbede for the time and the ball in the new season.
The competition may not come soon, and Simons needs to adapt to the NBA, and Enbede is going to recover from the injury as soon as possible, but whether the Okafor has a place in the 76ers's long array is still a problem.
Last season, Okafor 32% scored low, which was higher than Cousins, Vucevic and Brooke Lopez, while his usage was high in the top 40 of the league.
As the Simons has shown the potential for possession of the ball, Enbede also has a better fit for NBA games, and Okafor's position is likely to be hard to secure.
In the past two seasons, Thompson's usage has stabilized at the league's top 20, and this is the best two seasons of his career.
The problem, however, is that with Durant's arrival, Thompson's usage is bound to fall, which is bound to affect his performance.
The effect will not only be the impact of the number of shots, but it will also be a significant reduction in the next season, and in some ways it will make it harder for opponents to defend him.
Durant's arrival is sure to shrink the Warriors' players, but perhaps the worst of these is Thompson.
But that doesn't mean that Tang's level has gone backwards, more like he made a sacrifice for the team as a whole.
Parker's performance in the last season was better than the data, not just because he was at the top of his basket, and his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs.
Duncan retired, Ginobili announced another year of war, and the GDP portfolio eventually ended, and as the youngest of the three, there was not much oil in the fuel tank of the French sports car.
After winning the third championship ring, Abdul Jabbar, Jordan and Russell won more of the season MVP than James, and Jordan was the only one who was more FMVP than James.
Oh, by the way, James has just brought the first professional sports championship trophy for Cleveland in the last 52 years.
James, who has come to the 14th season of his career, needs a better guarantee of physical strength to prepare for the playoffs.
So, in the regular season, James's data is likely to fall further, and he will take more of the burden to Owen, but he will still be able to easily become the first three players in the league.
"The talent learned from the country must be developed in Russia, "he said.
On the 12th day of the local time, Huang Jing, chairman of the Chinese Federation of overseas Chinese in Moscow, said he was excited when he saw a reporter in the middle.
Not long ago, she participated in a training course on Chinese talent (calligraphy, painting) of the overseas Chinese cultural community, hosted by the Chinese State Council Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and hosted by Jinan University.
In the course of the training course, he did not know where to start with calligraphy and painting, and the result was able to draw and write his own work at the end of the training course.
After returning to Moscow, he must use the knowledge and skills he has learned to make his own contribution to the spread and promotion of Chinese culture.
Mr Yanwei, Secretary-General of the Russian Association for the promotion of Chinese culture at the same time, had the same feeling.
She said she had made great progress with the help of the teacher of the training course and felt the responsibility of being the "overseas communicator of Chinese culture."
Mr Yanwei said he went back to Russia to spread and carry forward the Chinese traditional culture among the Chinese and the Russian people who love Chinese culture.

The British team won a silver medal in the seven-member rugby game and Fiji won the gold medal
In the finals of the seven-member football match on Thursday night, the British team failed to perform well before the Fiji team and was defeated by the Fiji team in 43-7 at the Rio Theodore stadium.
Fiji won the gold medal for its impeccable performance in possession, theft, avoidance, coordination, running and power, the first Olympic medal in the country's history.
The silver medal was a small consolation for the defeated British team, the third silver medal awarded by the British delegation on the same day, which was enough to make the British rugby team proud: They beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa for the first time they entered the Olympic Games.
Earlier that day, the British team narrowly defeated South Africa by 7-5, which could have affected their status in the final.
But in any case, the Fiji team is enough to defeat a full-bodied 15-man team.
Tomorrow, at least one Englishman will wear a gold medal, which may be a comfort to the British team, but it may not be. The Englishman is Fiji coach Ben Ryan from Wimbledon, who has been the head coach of the British team.
It is not easy for the British team to achieve today's results.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's coaching, they did not taste the fruit in the Adlaid international rugby game.
Now, they are only a step away from the champion.
Although they have suffered a huge blow, they have made remarkable progress.
The opening of Fiji took the advantage, leaving the British team defenseless.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like hitting a series of moving buses. When Osie Coliniso rushed into the corner, the world series champion team was ahead of the 5-0 score.
Just four minutes after the game, Jerry Tooley scored again on the right.
12-0, the British team had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's powerful interdiction allowed the giant's general Leon Nakalava not to score a third time, but it merely slowed the pace of Fiji's scoring.
In seven minutes, Yasa Velemaru was in the corner of the right-hand right-hand corner. 17-0, the British team added insult to injury.
The Karawa scored again, and the game... There was one minute left in the first half of the game.
Then Tretmo Thevovo broke through the British team's defense and went straight to the scoring line.
The score was already 29-0 when there was a break in the midfield.
Fiji seems to have been born to play seven football, and the British team is still a novice.
This is the case.
The British team made a huge change in the second half and hit the Fijian defence in the last four minutes, and in the first half, the performance was good, but the Fiji team played a wonderful match, scoring again by Joshua Tuesova.
Dan Norton gave the British team a chance to score and changed the score to 36-7 in the left corner, but the game was already under the control of the South China Sea Island, with fans singing, waving flags and singing and dancing on the platform.
The wonderful performance of the Fiji team has to be applauded.
At the last minute, Mata William prevented the Fiji team from an indifferent attack.
The final whistle sounded, and the Fijian embraced, and the defeated British team could only regret the exit.
In the first half of the day, Fiji defeated the Japanese team by 20-5 in the semi-final, while Britain narrowly defeated South Africa in a fierce semi-final.
In the first half, Kyle Brown helped South Africa to take the lead, but Dan Norton scored in the second half with a superb .
After that, England's Anthony's brother Marcus Watson ensured the team's victory with a wonderful interception, and the British team finally won the silver medal.
Helen Graff and Heather Stanning were inspired by cancer coaches to win a gold medal in rowing
It's no exaggeration to say that this is one of the most moving gold medals.
From the start of the first paddle to the present, Helen Graff and Heather Stanning have received 220 punitive training, and the gold medals they won in Estacio da Lagoa have a more extraordinary significance.
Although only two of them were rowing, there was a man on board, the coach Robin Williams, who had been with them for the second consecutive women's double-paddle Olympic gold medal, the first in Britain to reach the height of the rowing women's portfolio.
They have kept 39 unbeaten records and have an absolute advantage.
What we see is that these two talented athletes walk gracefully on the surface of the water, but this is not the whole of this victory.
Behind every gold medal in rowing, there are a lot of volunteers who make a difference, and one of the most helpful is the coach who learned that he was suffering from cancer 30 months ago and didn't know if he could live to see the day.
As he said, death can come at any time.
I had bladder cancer, and they had surgery for me.
If you don't do the surgery, the cancer will spread all over the body.
In this way, the situation would be much worse.
This will change your mind a little.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he began treatment in early 2014, minimizing the impact, although it may not be appropriate in this case.
I need to get my salary, so I have to get better soon.
It was an inspiration to me.
I lived in the hospital, although they said it would be enough to walk a few steps, but I walked about 20 feet, 30 feet and 50 feet around the ward every time.
This is the beginning of everything.
The rowing movement itself is a journey, and this makes the journey a little longer.
At the moment of gold, the first thing they thought was Williams. This morning Williams talked a little more than usual, in order to overcome his anxiety.
"I'm in a bad mood this week and may be a bit of an extreme, but this gold medal really means a lot," she said, following a visit to Afghanistan after Stanning, the captain of the Royal Artillery Corps.
It repeatedly told me how important it was to me, and how hard it was for me, Helen, and Robin.
This is Helen, Robin and I have worked hard for three years in return.
If there's no Robin, we're just a nobody, thank him very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have found a better trainer and coach than he was.
Helen Graff and Heather Stanning have not suffered a defeat in five years.
The severity of the punishment for the combination is unmatched by their rivals.
Even at the end of the last 500 meters, New Zealand and Denmark began to close, and Stanning and Graff still had a lot of physical reserves.
It was really exciting at the time.
Helen cried, "keep the rhythm and keep the rhythm."
It's really important not to be influenced by your opponents.
We have a very good start, and we are not looking forward to doing great things.
We didn't think about the glory of today, we just wanted to make each oar and win the game, and we did it.
The pair took a year to decide their own future.
Graff will be married to the television Explorer Steve Bhakmashal next month.
But now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don't want to say this is my last game.
It's going to put too much pressure on me.
In London, it took me about six months to realize that I was the Olympic champion.
It was a completely new experience, and I felt very nervous.
It's been about four minutes now.
"I feel much better," she says.

Snapchat's "Anime" Effect is referred to as a satire on Asians
Snapchat said the filter was inspired by animation, but some observers thought it had racial overtones.
Snapchat's 150 million daily users can change reality through their filter tools and make people look ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a role in a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
These lenses have the effect of passivation, bending characteristics, and produce more than 30 million a modified self-timer every day.
Any mistakes will immediately be brought to the attention of the public.
The Snapchat lens has been criticized for promoting the use of black or white skin as a beauty.
As a result, when the application provides a filter for some users this week to create , weird teeth and pink face effects, some critics call it a racial satire on the "yellow species" in Asia.
They even consider whether these recurring problems mean that the company has a bigger problem with diversity.
On Wednesday, The Verge and Motherboard's report sparked outrage after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company's explanation is that the filter is a tribute to the anime character, rather than a satire on Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of the hurtful stereotypes in reality.
Others are also firmly opposed to these cartoon images.
The filters, "at least uncomfortable and uncomfortable," were published in an e-mail by a korean-american artist who published Twitter and was widely shared in the photos.
"It's hard to tell the effect of an extremely disgusting Asian satirical image and filter, "she added.
Although the filter is not only the yellow race, but the yellow people are extremely demeaning.
Snapchat is not the only company that has touched the bottom line of these cultures.
From the company's board of directors to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, American culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusiveness.
Snapchat's huge young group is likely to be very sensitive because of its greater focus on racial diversity than the older generation.
When a Snapchat filter created an insult to the user, Zhu Katie, 25, said in an interview Thursday: "This sort of thing is more difficult to escape than before."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer in Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article written for Medium and a telephone interview, she said she thought racial controversy reflected a lack of racial diversity in the recruitment process.
Ms Zhu criticized the company's employees, most of whom were white, and the leadership was all male and added a label at the end of the article: # DeleteSnapchat.
As a Chinese American, Ms Zhu said: "Either their employees do not have a variety of races, so they can make such a decision, or there are some colored people in their employees, but their jobs won't allow them to speak freely."
Other observers shared the complaint that she had not been responded to by the Snapchat.
The company did not release data on the diversity of its staff and said it was a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the ethnic background of its employees, but a spokesman said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on a lower proportion of the population, as well as to promote internal inclusiveness.
Ms Zhu said she would close her Snapchat account: "I would like to know if they need more users like us against the act."
The congressional panel said military officials had distorted the intelligence of Isis
In a report released on Thursday, a congressional panel noted that officials of the United States Central Command changed intelligence reports and described the war on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as more optimistic than the actual situation.
The mid-term report comes from a special working group set up by the Republican chairman of the house military Commission, the intelligence Commission and the House Appropriations Committee, which says the Central Command intelligence analyst has "widespread grievances", which say superiors are tampering with their assessment of the war between the United States and the Islamic State.
The central command in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing U.S. Military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news report on the report, "the information examined by senior leaders of the central command is more optimistic than the actual situation, and is always more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies," he said.
"The Central Command's behavior is unacceptable, "said the Republican representative in California. On the other hand, our fighters are suffering from war, and the other is the wrong analysis of high-level policymakers."
The leadership problem of the central command has extended to the highest level of the Agency.
The report details the long-standing problems of the central command in the description and analysis of United States training in the Iraqi army in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials have ordered changes to these reports, according to the report, these analysts feel that they are under pressure from the leaders of the central command to make more optimistic comments about the threat posed by the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).
"In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimony were much more optimistic than the actual situation, "the report said.
For example, a central command official stated publicly that a major military operation could be taken back to Mosul as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, the results have been very clear, "said Mike Pmpeou, a Kansas Republican representative, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most high-level intelligence officials from the United States Central Command manipulated the command's intelligence products, concealing the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq.
The Republican Party has set up a special working group after he learned from analysts that intelligence about the Islamic State was manipulated.
As the investigation continues, more discoveries will be made following the report released on Thursday.
The Attorney General of the Ministry of Defence has also conducted a long-term investigation of the central command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their findings on Thursday, in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
In a statement, the Committee's Democratic leader, Xieandar, said in a statement: Between 2014 and 2015, the central command has developed an overly narrow process for intelligence assessments of the Islamic State and Iraqi peacekeeping forces.
Mr Xieandar said the process "hampered the release of intelligence", reduced analysts' morale and "could not accept different views."
But Mr Xieandar and Democrats also said they did not find any evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on analysts at the central command, so that their conclusions were consistent with "default or political narrative."
The wild beast Daily reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of a congressional investigation.
Last August, the New York Times reported that the Attorney General of the Pentagon began an investigation after receiving a complaint from the central command analyst.
A Pentagon spokesman, major Patrick Evans, said in a statement that the Defense Department did not comment on the congressional report until the attorney general's investigation was over.
But he said: "Experts sometimes disagree about the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense encourage a healthy dialogue on these important national security themes."
The impact of the investigation has gone beyond the question of whether the United states-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria has been successful (as has been claimed by a growing number of Defense officials).
But last year, the claim. raised public questions about the extent to which President Obama could trust the Central Command 's assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis areas.
Criticism of the Islamic State's intelligence is reminiscent of the controversy over a decade ago when the Central Command intelligence analyst Gregory Hook wrote a study stating that George W. Bush's government, despite the opposition of many analysts, insisted on sending small troops to Iraq and hardly considering the post-invasion situation in 2003.
Mr hooker played a key role in the campaign against the Islamic State's intelligence.
Last year, officials said Mr Hooker's team had concluded that air strikes against the Islamic State refinery did not significantly reduce the economic income of terrorist groups, because the terrorist organization had built temporary refineries to continue selling oil on the black market, which was very different from what was announced.
According to Time magazine's September report, the central command did not publicize the discovery.
The commander of the central command, Lloyd Austin III, was criticized last year after several lawyers reviewed the Senate testimony about an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and is now being replaced by Joseph Walter in his position at the central command.
The United States won four wins in the women's hockey game and is going to win the game with Britain
Katie , one of the only three dollars in 6-1's victory over Japan, took the lead on Thursday for the American women's hockey team, helping the U.S. Team to beat the Indian team with 3-0.
Five goals in two games were stunning, but the 27-year-old Bam said she didn't know she was doing so well.
"I don't know anything about that," she says.
I'm not the kind of person who will remember that I've scored a few goals.
What she knew was that the United States had won four games in the Olympics and would compete with the team in the team for the first time on Thursday when the team failed to defeat the Japanese team with 2-0.
Britain and the United States faced each other in the first round of the game on Saturday.
Both teams will be promoted to the quarter-finals, and the game will determine who will appear as the group's first.
The team's first team will be able to avoid having a strong Dutch team and be able to go further. The Dutch are in the first place as another team.
The U.S. Team made a miracle in Saturday's game, knowing that the United States was at the bottom of the 12 teams four years ago at the London Games.
Bam was also in that team at the time.
Bam grew up in Bruber, Pennsylvania, who picked up the hockey stick for the first time at the age of three (her twin sister in Drexel) and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming the youngest member of the national team so far.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she failed to make the final list.
In 2012, she and her teammates were not to be seen.
The next year, the British Craig Parnham acted as head coach, and everything began to change.
"It's a cultural, mental and substantive change, "he said.
We had not reached the current level in London at that time.
We've come to a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam hit the top in the first half with a near-distance backhand shot.
India had not yet tasted the fruit in the game, but the team showed an amazing tenacity and kept the 1-0 score close to the end of the third quarter, when the Bam broke out.
She took the ball for a long run along the left side of the court, then cut into the middle, shot into the net, and the U.S. Team 2-0 led.
Melissa Gonz scored the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The United States against goalkeeper Jackie Bridregis for the first time in the game, in the first three victories, rivals each scored a goal.
This time she played an extraordinary role.
So is the Bam, too.
"We are in good shape now, "Parnham says, but how good it is will depend on the results of Saturday's match.
The shabby food during the Great Depression of the big meal
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had just been elected president, sat in the president's office for lunch.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt liked the cuisine of Fifth Avenue, such as goose liver and Maryland stew.
On that day, his menu was very simple: Ketchup devil eggs, mashed potatoes, and fruit pudding as a snack.
"This is to share the joys and sorrows of the people who are suffering, "he said.
"It also reflects the way Americans eat, "added her husband, Andrew Ko.
The couple, who live in the Brooklyn highlands, are food historians.
Mr Cohen's last book, fried stew, is about American Chinese food, and Ms Ziegman tells the story of the slum tenants through food in her "97 Orchard" book.
Their co-authored new book, the big meal, will be published by Harper press on Tuesday, the history of American food during the Great Depression.
After showing some common ideas about food, they met a reporter at the Eisenberger sandwich shop, a simple lunch counter in the -iron zone that has been open since the collapse of the economy in 1929.
Ms. Ziegman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwiches, while Mr Cohen, 57, ordered a turkey, mashed potatoes, and a vegetable platter.
The reporter ordered a bakery, which the couple considered fit to discuss the diet during the Great Depression.
"The bread was very popular at the time, "said Ms. Ziegman.
At that time, there were peanut bread, liver bread, and soybean bread.
They are made of a raw material and a cheap that can be poured on the raw material.
Imagine your dinner is peanuts.
Mr Ko made a face.
"They are definitely like lead in your stomach, "he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, Americans had a buffet, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cooked meals for male farm workers, breakfast, lunch, and dinner with freshly picked pies.
In the first world war, it was the Americans who gave food to hungry Europeans. The big meal records how the country suddenly ceased to be a place of abundance.
Mr Ko explained why he and his wife wanted to write the book: "At that time, food had become a major topic of unhappiness for Americans."
Another unpleasant topic was the shabby new food: Bread and stew as the main course, and stew was "the best recipe for leftovers," Ms. Ziegman said, because chefs could use butter in sauces to cover up the hard food.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dried fruit.
The meat that has been the protagonist of the American table for many years has turned into a rare luxury.
A strange mix of calories, more than a taste, or even a basic cooking sense, is the first thing people think about nutrition.
In the course of studying the book, including a variety of recipes, Ms. Ziegman produced a baked onion stuffed with peanut oil.
"This is not common at the dinner table, "Mr. Ko said.
"It's weird, too, "Ms Ziegman said.
Peanut oil and grilled onions can't match at all.
This is a feature of many family economic meals.
Family economists have influenced the country's eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, a chef at the federal family economic services department in 1923 to 1943, which is unique in history.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines to encourage women to be "frugal" and to be brave enough to turn cream spaghetti with carrots and other bad foods into gourmet food.
"The big meal "is a rich" historical treasure. "
What is particularly interesting is the government's response to the hungry people, such as President Herbert Hoover, "I can't manage other people's business."
Although he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse in his childhood, his diet was as delicate as a millionaire.
"He likes to eat European western food, such as fish and cucumber sauce, "Mr. Ko said.
He was dressed in a tuxedo, eating in a gilded dining room.
He was obviously detached from the people.
If it weren't for his wife Eleanor to encourage him to set an example in his diet, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
As the book says, the housekeeper employed by Ms. Roosevelt was not interested in the taste, so the White House "food is not only the most difficult food in Washington, but the worst food for cooking."
When the United States comes back to normal, many of the ways of cooking in the great depression have been abandoned.
Ms. Ziegman said what was left was our focus on calories and nutrition and the application of science to cooking.
The couple said that in writing the book, they learned more about the eating habits of Ms. Ziegman's mother, such as how she did not throw away food.
"She was very afraid to waste food, "Mr. Ko said.
"She actually makes a lot of people sick, "Ms. Ziegman recalls.
For example, there was once a "cream puff" incident.
After removing the plates, she and Mr Ko took out a dessert they had prepared at home: This was the fruit pudding that President Roosevelt had eaten at lunch.
"It's called butter dried fruit, "Ms. Ziegman said." And adding a trendy name to a common dish is "the usual trick."
There is no raw cream in this dessert, only dried fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone was reluctant to make the spoon deep into the thick brown paste.
Unexpectedly, the taste of this dessert is not bad.
Mr Ko ate the second spoon and the third spoon again.
He thought it was an acceptable dessert, and told his wife: "It would be better to add some crushed walnuts."
Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report shows that the production of crude oil continued to increase in July and Saudi output hit a new high.
The report does not help the market to doubt the credibility of OPEC, and the road to recovery is likely to be full of thorns.
On Monday, the head of OPEC and the head of Qatar's energy minister, Sadat, said OPEC would hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28.
A monthly report released by OPEC on Wednesday showed that the entire OPEC organization, including Gabon, increased its production by 46,000 barrels in July to 33.11 million barrels.
The low price of crude oil has prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil products, adding to the oversupply in the market, OPEC said in a monthly report.
The impact of the news, combined with an increase in U.S. Crude oil production expectations and an unexpected increase in crude oil inventories, caused international oil prices to fall for two consecutive days.
As of Wednesday, light crude oil futures, delivered in September by the New York Mercantile Exchange, fell 2.48%, and London's Brent crude futures, which were delivered in October, fell 2.07%.
Reuters believes the proposed oil-producing meeting is unlikely to tighten supply significantly, and the data released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration also depress market sentiment.
On Wednesday, Iran's official news agency Fars quoted the Iranian oil minister Zangane as saying that Iran's crude oil production was up to 3.85 million barrels a day, the highest level since 2008.
As soon as the news of the meeting came out, Russian energy minister Nowak said there was no need for a new round of cold-production negotiations under the current oil price.
The last meeting of the oil-producing countries was in April, and OPEC member States have failed to agree on any measures.
Emma Richards, the oil and gas analyst at BMIResearch, said the market and the media could overreact to OPEC's upcoming meeting.
Helima Croft, head of commodities strategy at the Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC would change the market's mood by releasing signals that they would lead to an agreement.
The device is like a smoke and mirror that draws the eye of a person (deliberately misleading).
Eugen Weinberg, the head of commodities research at the German commercial bank, said the possibility of OPEC trying to stabilize the market through September was thought to be low.
This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC. After all, this organization has staged a "wolf."
In all parts of the country, special attention should be paid to the publication of medical advertisements, the concentration of complaints, and medical institutions that have been repeatedly punished.
The national health and family planning Commission and the State Administration of Chinese medicine will, in due course, organize supervision over the implementation of special supervision and inspection work in some provinces.
According to the media, as a result of the massive influx of capital into Internet medicine, the problem of current product homogeneity is serious, the investment boom is receding, capital enters the viewing period.
According to data from the Hong Kong Alexander Hospital Management Research Center, Internet health-care companies have died a lot during the year, and some 20% of start-up Internet medical companies have ceased to exist.
However, as most Internet health-care companies struggle to finance a round or B round of financing, several segments of the world's leading companies still have access to capital .
It seems that the Internet medical start-up must not "rush", but to see the market demand, sink the heart to do a special, to do deep.
Yue Yee contributed 12 million yuan, the 40% of the registered capital, the Tom Thung instrument company, which contributed 18 million yuan, accounting for 60% of registered capital.
In recent years, with the state's policy support in the field of medical information, the electronic and integrated supply chain management system has gradually entered the hospitals at all levels.
The Yue Yee's cooperation with Tom Thung is aimed at the demand of the market, helping hospitals build an advanced supply chain management system, and as an opportunity to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many Internet health-care companies, iBaby has initially focused on the vertical field of Internet obstetrics, digging deep into pregnant mothers and doctors at both ends.
Pregnant mothers can not only be treated for free 24 hours and one-on-one doctors, but they can also pay targeted health care.
At the doctor's end, iBaby breaks geographical limits by organizing expert advice to grassroots doctors on online lectures, peer-to-peer exchanges, case discussions, and other micro-lectures.
At present, doctors have opened three plates for doctors to continue their education, doctors' social and medical help.
Provides services including online learning, case discussion, academic exchange, social platforms with hospitals, doctors and doctors, legal aid, entrepreneurial support, etc., needed for doctor-patient relationship or personal life.
According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently said that Ali's health "is willing to sink the heart" to take the health data.
Internet companies and data companies lack professionalism, and there is no unity in writing methods on the same entry.
Ali's current layout in the field of health care is divided into three parts: Ali's health, tiancat medical museum and Alipay future hospital.
Wang Lei admits that it is harder to start a health-care business than any other industry. "It's not just a matter of how much money you have, it's going to sink down and stay lonely and do it."
Staying up late to watch Olympic Games is prone to damage to the heart
The Brazilian Olympic Games are in full swing, and even when the games are broadcast in the middle of the night, many citizens will stay up late to watch.
The doctor warned, in particular, that staying up late to watch the games had a health hazard, which could lead to cardiovascular disease.
If you stay up late for a long time, the hormone will continue to secrete a lot, and people will continue to be in a state of intense excitement, unable to get normal recovery, which can cause blood vessels to contract and raise blood pressure, leading to cardiovascular disease.
Han Zhiyuan is particularly reminded that groups with cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood fat, smoking habits, family history, etc., are more likely to cause cardiovascular disease if they stay up late.
If you stay up late for a long time, not only can the cardiovascular function be affected, but the gastrointestinal function, immune system, neuroendocrine system will be affected, and even the risk of cancer will increase.
For older friends, Han Zhiyuan suggests trying not to stay up late to watch the Olympic Games, especially those with a history of cardiovascular disease.
During the last World Cup football match, Han Zhiyuan had seen a 60-year-old patient whose heart attack triggered or was associated with staying up late to watch the game.
This year, the Department has seen a number of patients with myocardial infarction or brain stroke around the age of 25, which is largely the result of a long stay in the patient's life, Han Zhiyuan said.
Don't stay up late every day, occasionally stay up late to watch your favorite sports events, and other projects may wait for the next day to watch a replay of the event.
When staying up late, add moisture in time, eat more fruit, can prevent blood vessel congestion, enhance the immunity of the body.

During the cold war, the Soviet Union brought missiles into Cuba and almost led to a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.
The event was seen as the pinnacle of the cold war, known as the "Cuban missile crisis."
It is not known, however, that during the cold war, a strong solar storm nearly led to a nuclear war by the United States against the Soviet Union, which was first published by researchers only on August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm caused strong interference with the U.S. Military's radar and radio communications in the Arctic.
These radars are part of the United States ballistic missile early warning system, which is used to monitor Soviet missiles.
The paper, which was completed by researchers at the University of Colorado in the United States, interviewed US military personnel involved in the forecasting and analysis of solar activity and consulted the non-confidential literature.
The paper wrote that in the 1960s, in order to prevent a sudden nuclear war in the Soviet Union, the United States Air Force had always had a portion of the aircraft carrying nuclear warheads flying in the sky.
The military commander of the U.S. Military did not know that the main culprit was the sun storm, not the Soviet Union, and ordered the fighters to enter the combat readiness.
Fortunately, the US military's solar activity, which began in the late 1950s and its study of electromagnetic interference on Earth, ultimately prevented this potential military conflict.
Later, he summarized the information provided by the aviation weather service of the United States Air Force and submitted a detailed report.
The immediate consequence of the solar storm is that the US military has since viewed space weather as a combat concern and has built a stronger space weather forecasting system.
During the day-to-day trip, the public found that the car was blocked by unfamiliar vehicles and could use the "micro- " function to solve this problem in the absence of an unfamiliar vehicle driver.
From August 11, Xi'an traffic police micro-letter service "Xi'an traffic police" launched the "micro-courier" service.
Following the introduction of this service, people in daily life can solve such problems by using the "micro- " function if they are not allowed to drive their vehicles while the driver is not on the scene.
This new service is quick to save administrative costs; the second is to respect and protect the personal privacy of citizens; and the third is all-weather, full-time service.
As long as the public has micro-letters, it can be very convenient to operate on its own, which makes it easier for both sides to "meet", ease the problem of parking, and reduce the number of security cases involved in the car.
On the other hand, in the case of a car owner who refuses to move, illegal parking or obstruction of traffic, Xi'an has indicated that the traffic police will take different disposal measures according to the actual situation and treat them as appropriate.

On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly published a new edition of the US-Japan defense cooperation guidelines in New York, allowing Japan's armed forces to play a more offensive role in the world.
This was the day U.S. Defense Secretary Carter, US Secretary of State John Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and Japanese Defense Minister Nakagawa attended a press conference in New York.
It was the fifth time the Chinese folk think-tank published the Japanese military assessment report, and it was the fourth to launch the English version.
The report is divided into nine chapters, including overall policy adjustment, military strength, defense budget, military deployment, weaponry and equipment, institutional development reform, military training, foreign military security cooperation, and military security relations with China.
The report says the year 2015 marks a stage for Abe's government to push ahead with major policy adjustments in the security field for several years.
Since then, Japan's initiatives in the field of security will be mainly at the operational level, such as the use of the rule of law, strategic follow-up and policy implementation, rather than significant adjustments and changes in the framework, mechanisms and policies.
The report stresses that Abe 's cabinet has tried to break through the above three points to push Japan 's "normal nationalization " and the self-defense forces to go out into international security affairs, strengthen Japan 's alliance of Japan and the United States, and combat China 's multi-purpose.
Previously, the China Association for the promotion of strategic culture issued the Japanese military assessment report on 5 June 2012, 19 July 2013, 23 July 2014 and 30 June 2015.

The residence is grey, and a perimeter fence, a second floor wall, barbed wire, and vehicle roadblocks are closely guarded.
Short board of public sports facilities
The black coal yard warehouse, turned into "green grass" football field; the red brick spire of the plant, turned into a modern sports hall.
In the national fitness day, the South Lok Mauan Sports Culture Park outside of Hangzhou Wangjiangmen opened the veil of mystery.
It was a coal yard, which had been left idle more than a decade ago, leaving a large number of illegal buildings and living garbage.
After the renovation, it has become a sports cultural park, and will be officially opened to the public in November, providing free sports venues for the public, and will undoubtedly open up a new fertile ground for all sports.
This is reminiscent of the Hangzhou Chen sports school, where China's top swimmer, Huangpu Military Academy, has come out with a number of world champions.
There is a steady stream of swimming stars, a vivid interpretation of the relationship between competitive sports and popular sports, which provides good conditions for the selection of professional players.
The level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of the all-round sport, which depends on the sport of the whole people in a certain sense, while the sport of the whole people depends on the conditions of the venue.
It is reported that as of 2015, China's per capita sports site area has been 150 times as long as the founding of New China, but it is still far behind the sports power.
In June this year, the State Council issued the National Fitness Plan (2016 - 2020), which will focus on the development of mass sports.
In order to fill this short board, on the one hand, the relevant departments should take full account of the layout of the stadium when carrying out the urban planning.
On the other hand, the established public stadiums, including those in schools such as schools, should be as open as possible in order to maximize the efficiency of their use.
The Rio Olympic Games, which are now in full swing, inspire people's enthusiasm for movement and awaken the sense of participation.
Gilliday gets lawyers' fees in the battle with Merck's hepatitis C patent
According to the US district judge, Gilliday science has the right to obtain legal fees in the case of hepatitis C patent litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck.
In June, after a US judge found that Merck had an illegal act, including perjury and other unethical behavior, Gilliday was exempted from paying $200 million in compensation for the Gilliday's best-selling drug Sophiewei and Hawoni's invasion of the two patents of Merck.
In Thursday's lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Beth Ramboson Freeman said the Gilliday did not have to bear the cost of the defense.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilliday, which governs the new generation of hepatitis C drug markets. Gilliday's drugs can cure hepatitis patients with more than 90%.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilliday and Merck sued each other, both claiming to be the owner of the Sophiewei's laboratory work, an effective ingredient in the Gilliday drug.
U.S.-backed forces announced that they had taken the Mambidi back from the Islamic State
A spokesman for the force said on Friday that the remaining Islamic State soldiers in the city had left, and the troops supported by the United States had fully controlled the northern city of Mambidi, near the Turkish border.
Following the departure of militants hiding in the city, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now sweeping the city.
Shalan Darwish, the Shalan Darwish military Commission of the Syrian Democratic Forces, told Reuters that they had rescued more than 2,000 civilians who had been abducted by militants.
"Mambidi is under our control now, but we're still working on it," he told Reuters.
The Clinton couple earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax on 34.2%
Hillary Clinton released its -year tax return on Friday, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid the 34.2% federal tax.
In 2015, the Clinton couple's charitable contributions amounted to $1 million, most of which contributed to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton's speech cost nearly $5.3 million, while the former secretary of state earned $300 million from the publisher Simon and Schuster on a book about her tenure in the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, Senator Tim Kane of the federal state of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holden, have published a 10-year tax return.
The two paid 20.3% of federal taxes in 2015.
Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane will continue to be a benchmark for financial transparency, "Clinton's campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump masks on false grounds and withdraws his previous commitment to publish tax returns.
Although the law does not require it, it is customary for US presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns.
As a New York businessman, Trump, as well as his lawyer, used the IRS audit as a reason to refuse to publish tax returns.
The Clinton campaign aide Ian Sameth, on Twitter, said it was up to you, and attached a link to the Democratic candidate's tax declaration form.
On Thursday, Trump's special legal adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish tax returns until the audit was completed.
Critics of Trump, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, said that Trump 's refusal to publish a tax declaration would raise questions about its net worth, charitable contributions, business deals and other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton seized on the issue and launched a web video on Friday, highlighting high-profile Democrats urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, she raised the issue in an economic policy speech in Michigan.
"For decades, he has refused to publish his tax returns like other presidential candidates, "she said to the crowd.
Trump had barely paid a penny for two years in the 1990s, according to the politicians news network, and the New York Times business columnist quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, saying that the current situation might still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a big issue in the presidential campaign.
Clinton named a rule in the name of a billionaire investor Warren Buffett to ensure that people earning more than $1 a year pay at least 30% of taxes.
President Obama has also supported the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Mr Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also undergoing the IRS audit, and that Trump was "afraid" not of tax authorities, but voters.
The earliest tax returns released by the Clinton campaign group were 2007.
The average federal tax rate paid by the Clinton couple living in New York's Chabak for the period from 2007 to 2014 reached about 32%, with a combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clinton couple's tax returns for 2015 show that, unlike most Americans, their salary income is only $100.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clinton couple's dividend and interest income was $109,000.

Jewish film-makers criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's telephone code in line with Arab customers' demands - Reuters News
A French film producer with Jewish ancestry told the media that the Kempinski Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's telephone code, and the hotel staff said it was based on the "demands" of Arab clients, which sparked an outcry.
Claude Longman, author of the Holocaust documentary, the Holocaust, expressed his disappointment at the Kempinski Hotel and published an open letter in Germany's Frankfurt report.
During the recent check-in, Lanzman wants to find Israel on the list of phone code provided by the hotel.
But Israel is not among the countries where guests can call directly from the room.
Has Israel disappeared in the German capital, Berlin, in 2016?
Lanzman wrote.
Instead, guests can call the Israeli phone through the call center of the Kempinski Hotel.
In search of an explanation, the film producer asked the front desk of the hotel.
In his letter, Lanzman said the response he received at the front desk was "shocking."
The hotel staff said it was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel."
And the reason for doing so is to make the film producer angry.
Lanzman cited the employee's exact words: Most of our guests were Arabs, and they demanded the deletion of Israel's code.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yaakov Adass Hadesman, described the matter as "a disgrace," according to the Rio daily.
We were surprised to learn of the incident.
This is a great shame in itself.
And what happened in Germany and the hotel chain was a disgrace.
There is no need for any explanation for this matter.
"We want the hotel to come to the right conclusion, "the official said.
The incident sparked a heated debate online, and everyone thought it was a scandal.
Some argue that the Kempinski Hotel is simply "servile" to meet the demands of Arab clients.
Another post pointed to the hotel "really don't have a face" and pointed out that the main street in the famous Kudam street was near a synagogue.
According to Der Spiegel, the hotel quickly clarified all allegations, claiming that everything was "negligent" and "apologized" to the Lanzman.
The Rio Daily quoted the Kempinski representative as saying: "There has never been a direct order to remove Israel from the fast-dial list."
The paper also says Israel's code has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to expel the protesting Brazilian students
In Sao Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday, students clashed with police during a protest against the government's reform of the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to evict protesters.
The incident was the result of an attempt by law enforcement officials to disperse students, so police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the March and expressed their dissatisfaction with the programmes.
In order to save money, the governor of the state of São Paulo, Oakeming, plans to close the 100 public school, and 300,000 students will be transferred.
Some of the protesting students expressed their dissatisfaction with the interim President Michel Temer through graffiti on the wall.
Just a few days before a recent protest, protesters marched on the streets to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the state Senate.
The Scottish cyclist, Carl Skinner, won the gold medal after winning the gold medal
Scottish cyclist Carl Skinner last night helped Britain's three-man team to defend the Olympic gold medal after the 2012 London Olympic Games at the Rio cycling men's team competition.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist, who replaced his Scottish compatriot, Sir Chris Hoy, became the backbone of the team, and even the legendary cyclist was proud of him as a young Skinner defeated the popular New Zealand team and returned to glory.
Four years ago, the British team was a blockbuster, and Hoey won the fifth of the six Olympic gold medals.
The British team was only sixth in the world cycling Championships in London in March, when he retired. Then the British team became more brilliant.
During the Beijing Olympics to the London Olympics, the British team's problem was the replacement of the "first circle of experts" Jamie Staff.
This was exactly what the convoy did when Sydnes appeared.
Hoy's retirement also left a gap, and Kian Emamdi and Matt Cranpton wanted to fill the gap.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the British team's coaching staff insisted that he be included in the national team, and Skinner was in the end.
Skinner's partner, Sydnes and Kenny, who won a gold medal with Hoey four years ago, updated the Olympic record in the qualifying period, but the result was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
And the three British cyclists finally beat their opponents and won the gold medal.
Although Sydnes was a little behind, Kenny was ahead of the team, and Skinner kept the lead at the end of the game.
The change in strategy is the key to this reversal, and Sydnes has chosen the larger flywheel, so the speed is slower, and this allows Kenny, especially Skinner, to keep pace.
He watched the game as a BBC commentator, and Skinner, Kenny and Sydnes saw him on the podium.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist, Skinner, said: "I am flattered."
I just do what I can to make a name for myself.
We created the Olympic record in the final and beat the world champion.
This is unbelievable.
There is nothing better than this victory.
After winning a gold medal with Kenny and Hoey at the 2012 London Olympics, Sydnes admitted that he was deliberately thrown down on the track in a bad start.
Later, he withdrew the comment, and England's rivals were unable to appeal.
And this victory did not have any such problems.
"It's like in London, with the British flag on the platform, "said Sydnes.
We just had a team three months ago.
We've lost a lot of World Champions, so it's amazing to be able to defend the Olympic champion.
It was just a game and a gold medal for the British team, who won seven gold medals at the Beijing Olympics and the London Olympics.
If this symbolizes the progress we have made over the past five months, we will continue to be successful in the bike pavilion in the next five days.
According to Kenny's state, he was not unlikely to reproduce his feat of winning three gold medals at an Olympic Games.
If so, he will have six gold medals and one silver medal when he is 12 years younger and also on March 23 (this day seems to be the holy day of the British sports world, Steve Redgrave, Mo farra, and Roger Bannister were born on the day).
The achievement was the same as that of .
Kenny will be fighting for a three-day race at the start of today.
"I'm going to focus on this game for the time being," the 28-year-old said.
The team race is always the best.
You can win the game with your teammates.
Frankly speaking, it's a bit lonely for a man to win.
"If he can win another two gold medals, he should be awarded a knighthood, "Sydnes said.
It was the only game that produced a medal on the day, but the British team had received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Irving Doole were promoted to the four-kilometer group chase race with the fastest results.
Their achievement is 351.943.
The world record for the 2012 London Olympic gold medal winner is 351.659.
The first round and the final ( 10:42 PM) will be held on the second day of the game today, and Wilkins will undoubtedly be the focus of attention.
Yesterday he had a dispute with the competition officer before the qualifying match, when the match officials asked him to measure height.
In the women's race, which will end tomorrow, Laura Trout, Joanan Rossel, Eleanor Barker and Kate Archbold from Milgay are promoted by the new world record 413.260.
The British team took the initiative in the middle of the games and won a number of medals in the middle of the games, relying on a strong site.
After displaying its absolute dominance at the Beijing and London games, the British cycling team was a bit disappointed in the course of its journey to Rio.
There have been many twists and turns, including April technical director Sean Sutton's resignation as a result of gender discrimination and bullying, as well as the retirement of legendary figures such as Hoy, Victoria Pendleton.
But the first night of the bicycle Pavilion is enough to prove that the British team will be on the verge of reaching its peak at a critical moment.
When little life comes to this world, Mom and Dad are responsible for this life, not only in the physical health of the child, but also in the development of the spirit, that is, education.
If you fail in the education of your children, you will not be able to make up for the shortcomings of life and the failure of the family, even if the cause succeeds again.

On 16 October 2014, the Shuyang court made a civil ruling, ruling that 2000 was not allowed to be transferred or sold without permission, in the case of the laying hens in all the farms.
After receiving the arrest order, Lee secretly sold some of the hens in the farm without the permission of the Shu Yang court.
As of March 8, 2015, when the public security bureau of Shuyang County was surveyed, only 142 hens were left in the farm.
On August 12, the reporter learned that the Beijing Winter Olympic Games and the Winter Paralympic Games Organizing Committee issued a public announcement that the Beijing Winter Olympic Committee inherited the Beijing Winter Olympic bid emblem, logo and other intellectual property rights.
No one is allowed to use the emblem and logo of the Beijing Winter Olympic bid for commercial purposes without the permission of the Beijing Winter Olympic Committee.
The head of the Division for Industry Coordination of the National Development and Reform Commission said here today that overcapacity in iron and steel is a global problem.
China's near-annual capacity utilization ratio is higher than the global average, and is higher than that of countries and regions such as the US and Europe.
China has taken resolute and effective measures to resolve excess capacity, and the results are gradually emerging.
The officer-in-charge pointed out that the Central Committee of the Central Committee attached great importance to the global problem of overcapacity in steel production.
All departments and regions are actively engaged in the implementation of the State Council's deployment and earnestly carry out their work. This year, it will reduce raw steel production capacity of about 45 million tons.
From China's national conditions, our country does not encourage the export of steel, on the contrary, a series of practical measures to control the export of steel.
The officer-in-charge stressed that international trade in iron and steel products is essentially market behavior, which stems from the needs of importing countries, consumers' comprehensive consideration of the value of products and other factors.
The implementation of trade protection measures will not contribute to a fundamental solution to the development of the global steel industry; on the contrary, it will only have a further impact on the international trade order.
When it comes to debt, the officer-in-charge stressed that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly addressed in the process of eliminating excess capacity.
Because of the size and scope of the assets of iron and steel enterprises, the debt relationship of some enterprises is complex, and if it is not properly disposed of, it is likely to trigger regional risks.
According to the officer-in-charge, in recent years, with the downward pressure on the economy, the overall demand for society has gradually weakened, and the utilization rate of some industries has declined, and the difficulties of production and operation of enterprises have been increased.
Some enterprises do not adapt to the changes in the market environment, production and operation is unsustainable and even close to collapse, but by some institutional mechanism constraints, the obstacles to market exit are more obstacles, become "zombie enterprises."
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces the efficiency of factor resource utilization, increases the cost of social management and hinders the establishment of a fair competitive market environment.
The main cause of losses is the same as the dilemma faced by the global steel industry - a weak market demand and low capacity utilization.
Our country mainly adopts the market mechanism, the economic means and the rule of law, the government is mainly to do good worker support and social stability work, to ensure fair and fair market order.
The officer-in-charge stressed that the next step would be to continue to do a good job of production capacity and ensure the completion of the five-year target mission of $100 million to 150 million tons of crude steel production capacity.
On the afternoon of October 10, when the Chinese tourist police appeared in Red Square in Moscow, it was immediately noticed that Chinese tourists waved with surprise, and locals and foreign tourists stopped to look back.
On the same day, China's first professional tourist police force, a member of the tourism police detachment of the city of Sanya in Hainan Province, came to Moscow to exchange study with the local tourist police on duty.
Moscow's tourist police are divided into three teams in Red Square, Nicolthesky pedestrian street, Kitgum department store and so on, with the Chinese tourist police working together to learn from the post. The whole process lasted for over an hour.
Female police officer Lucchini is more than 20 years old, fluent in English and Spanish, and she just joined the tourist police last year.
He went all the way to observe what Russian colleagues said and do, and to communicate with her from time to time.
When the Spanish tourists came to consult, the Moscow tourist police gave him a patient explanation in fluent Spanish, which impressed the Wang Bing.
"Every one of the Moscow tourist police has a foreign language, and some of them will have more than two doors, which touches us very much. "
"Hainan, as an international tourist island, is gradually paying attention to attracting international tourists, and we want to improve our capabilities to match the status of the international tourism island."
Before working with the gang on the same day, the Chinese tourist police also went to the Moscow city tourist police brigade to communicate with their Russian counterparts.
"I often deal with Chinese tourists and I am very happy to see them travel to Russia."
"They usually turn to the question of how the road goes, where a monument is, how to rent it, and how to get back to the hotel. "
In recent years, Moscow's urban environment and tourism atmosphere has become better and more attractive to foreign tourists, said Raykorsakov, the head of the Moscow city tourism police brigade.
In order to meet the needs of tourism development, the tourist police force was set up in July 2014 to patrol the major attractions and help and channel tourists.
At present, all the Moscow tourist police are fluent in English and partly in Spanish and German.
The police brigade divided them into nine groups according to the level of foreign languages, two classes a week, learning self-defense, laws and regulations and foreign languages.
"There are now two travel police who have begun to study Chinese and have spoken well, and we have to continue to improve their Chinese, "Raykorsakov said.
Raykorsakov told reporters that since the establishment of the Moscow tourist police, a certain amount of experience has been accumulated and hopes to inspire its peers in Sanya.
In his view, the cooperation between the Russian and Chinese police departments will enhance the sense of security for their citizens to travel to each other's country.
"The recruitment of the Moscow tourist police, the police model, the equipment, and the good interaction with tourists have brought us a lot of inspiration, "Chen said.
At present, at least nine provinces and municipalities, including Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian and Beijing, have introduced the rules for the implementation of residence permits.
With regard to the conditions for applying for a residence permit, the above-mentioned areas are generally proposed to be inhabited for more than half a year and are in line with one of the conditions for lawful and stable employment, lawful stable residence and continuous schooling.
The reporter noted that in terms of the treatment offered by the residence permit, the percentage of gold content varies from place to place, and the scope of public services and facilities provided in some areas has increased in comparison with the provisions of the national version.
These areas have increased the convenience of their children to participate in the national college entrance examination at the local level under the relevant conditions.
In addition, Beijing, among other things, has clearly demanded that the scope of the provision of public services and facilities be gradually expanded and made available to the public on a regular basis.
For example, Fujian proposes to publish to the community at least once every three years the scope of public services and facilities to be enjoyed by the holder of a residence permit.
Under the temporary regulations on residence permits, the public security organ shall, within 15 days from the date of acceptance, produce a residence permit within 15 days from the date of receipt of the residence permit.
For the issuing time-limit, most of the areas are in line with the national version, that is, within 15 days.
Hebei has made it clear that the public security police station in the place of residence shall issue a residence permit within 3 working days from the date of receiving the application, in accordance with the conditions of application and the complete material.
The public security organ shall, within five working days from the date of acceptance, produce a residence permit within five working days from the date of acceptance.
In accordance with the provisions of the provisional regulations on residence permits, the above-mentioned areas are clear and apply for a residence permit for the first time, free of the value of the documents.
For example, Sichuan requires that local public security stations, or the entrusted community service agencies, strictly enforce the approved fee items and fee standards, and firmly ban over-scope, excessive fees or fees for vehicles.
According to the investigation, on July 27, 2016, the Deng Nan County Party Secretary of the former Ganzhou City of Ganzhou, Chen Yangxia, went to work for the Department of discipline inspection of the Province, and served as director of the supervision room of the party's style of work (Deputy Director level, one year of probation).
The wine that was consumed that night was provided by the Li Youcai individual, and the other costs were borne by the individual Liu.
The Department of discipline in Jiangxi Province said that people such as Chen Yangxia, Cheng Zilian and others had organized and accepted food in private clubs, in violation of the central eight rules and violated the Party's discipline.
Bogba had two yellow cards in the Italian Cup last season and will be suspended for one game in accordance with the rules.
Although he has moved back to the Premier League, the FA continues to extend his suspension to the Premier League.
As a result, his return to Manchester United's debut will be extended to a home game with Southampton on the 14th of Aug. 14, when Bogba will be on the sidelines.
As the first rookie of the year in 2014, Saric will officially make landfall in the NBA next season and join the 76ers in Philadelphia.
Saric is a young European player, and many fans don't know much about him, but through the games, it is believed that Saric's performance has left a deep impression on people.
The last time in Croatia's victory over Spain, Saric successfully capped Paul Gasol's attempt to drag the game into the basket at the end of the game.
Recently, 76ers manager Brett brown gave the Saric a high evaluation that the Spurs manager thought he had seen a young Manu - Ginobili shadow in Saric.
It is clear that Saric has shown his talent and let 76ers look forward to him.
In the first two games of the games, the Saric received 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.
In the first half, the Saric showed his ability to open space on the pitch, and he was able to shoot from the three-point line after being cut off from his team-mates.
Although the 76ers's interior is hoarding a lot of talented young players, they don't have an outside capacity for Saric.
There are only a handful of insider players who can do this in the NBA today from the cap to the long break and finish the assists.
Since the start of the games, Saric has scored 13 points, 8 rebounds and 5 assists in three games, with a full performance.
James has signed two 1 + 1 contracts since he decided to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014.
As the NBA's current labor agreement is about to enter the final year, James will be at the forefront of the labor agreement negotiations as a Vice-Chairman of the NBA players' Union.
Given the huge rise in the Union's income, thanks to the new TV relay agreement, and the fight between the boss and the players on how to deal with the money, it is feared that the NBA will fall into a halt next summer.
But for James, he doesn't have to worry about being a free player next summer, because he has signed a three-year contract with the Cavs.
No matter when the 2017 - 18 season officially begins, James is in the contract.
Since the iPhoneSE stunning appearance, the mobile phone market also ushered in the upsurge of the small screen machine.
Not long ago, Nubian also launched the first piece of its Z11 series: NubiaZ11mini.
NubiaZ11mini continues its consistently excellent photo gene and is equipped with a one-handed, easy-to-hold 5.0 inch screen, easy-to-use post-fingerprint identification, and a remarkable experience of using it.
Z11mini's just listed small screen photo phone Z11mini reduced the price of 200 yuan, from the original 1499 yuan to $1299.
In appearance, nubiaZ11mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen, and underneath it is still a classic "little red circle" design.
The middle frame is a metal material, and a Type-C data interface is designed and configured at the bottom.
The future of the Portland smelter is fraught with uncertainty as a result of the cancellation of the power supply contract
As power companies supplying power to the plant revealed that a factory owner would terminate a supply contract that would invalidate all supply contracts, the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria and hundreds of workers at the plant are now facing an uncertain future.
The move took place after the Victorian Government decided not to continue to issue subsidies to ensure the operation of the plant.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will be terminated in November.
2000 workers at the Portland plant in the US aluminium company are likely to face unemployment.
As soon as the plant is closed, there may be as many as 2000 people directly or indirectly unemployed.
And since the plant's electricity consumption accounts for about 10% all of Victoria's power output, it may also have a chain reaction.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Han Ruikai smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesey Island power plant last year.
The Portland smelter, the US aluminium company, is currently losing money and is at risk of closing down.
The move was made after a forecast of the plant in the next few years, initially because the Australian dollar was stronger, and more recently because of the price of the factory's products.
AGL provides electricity to the large aluminium smelter through the Rattrobb Valley's old Eiyang power plant, which predicts that the other three factory owners will also terminate their agreement.
The largest shareholder in the factory is a joint venture between a US aluminium company and alumina company, while China's CITIC group and Japan's pill red Co., also hold a small stake.
"AGL expects that the Portland plant will continue to operate, that is to say, the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand," the joint venture said.
AGL said the contracts were "hedging contracts" that should have been in force since November 2016.
The termination of the contract is 12 months, so they will be terminated in 2017.
"As a result, AGL continues to predict that the contracts will continue to generate revenue in the fiscal year 2017, "the power company said.
Any revenue impact on AGL since the fiscal year 2018 is now subject to an optimistic outlook for wholesale electricity prices in the futures market.
AGL said the company had written down the value of the $187 million contract in the "termination of activity expectations ".
The company said the decision to terminate the contracts "would not affect the ability of the us-aluminum company to operate the smelter or to guarantee its power supply."
The US company said it had signed a 20-year contract with the old Eiyang in 2010, which would have come into force in November, but the company did not explain why it had withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland smelter in Victoria, as well as the Tomago plant near Newcastle, will be closed because of the industry's poor economic situation.
In response to comments made earlier this week by analysts, AGL operations director Michelsen said Portland had an annual electricity consumption of about 600 megawatts and the Tomago plant reached about 900 megawatts.
If the two factories were shut down, the demand for the electricity market would be greatly reduced.
"As a power company, it's not a good news for us, "he said.
Community legal centres shut down 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups are barred from the community legal centres each year, and funding for this service is already stretched, and it is now faced with further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three out of every five persons were denied access to free legal advice and representation, the majority of whom were elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions.
The lack of funding for community legal services has already exceeded the limits and is now faced with further funding cuts.
From June next year, the federal government's funding for these legal centres will be reduced by a further 30%.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Legal Centre, said thousands of people were turned away each year, according to the latest national community Association Law Center survey.
Mr Farrell said the situation would only get worse if the federal government did not change the existing decision.
"The Queensland community legal Centre is chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people will not be able to get the important services they need, "he said.
Those who need to stay away from violence, those with huge debts that cannot be repaid, the shattered families and the squeezed workers face a legal dimension, and the report shows that they are not able to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut its funding for 30% from June 2017, meaning that thousands of vulnerable groups in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and the Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately withdraw the decision to cut funds so that people can get the help they need in the face of legal problems.
Last year, the state government promised to raise legal aid funds to the national average.
Attention must now be paid to the needs of community legal centres and their corresponding communities, and the Government of Bretsche must also invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team has been prosecuted for drawing a gun from a staff member
New Y ork: Trump 's campaign team was prosecuted for failing to take a gun to a staff member when he was driving a Jeep in February when the head of the North California State was driving a jeep.
Vincent Bodini, a former software trainer for the state's campaign team, described the incident at the state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bodini said he had hoped that the matter could be resolved internally, but after a few months he realised that "this could not happen."
According to Bodini, the head of the Earl Phillip, "pulled out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pointed the gun at the knee of the Vincent."
After complaining to the local and regional election team leadership, Bodini learned from the file that at least four other people had gone through the same thing.
"The failure to shoot does not mean that there will be no harm, "Bodini said in a complaint.
Just two days before the case, the Republican presidential candidate told the crowd in North Carolina that if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and chose her favorite judge, "those who supported the second amendment", the gun holder and the gun enthusiast, might take action, a statement that sparked outrage.
Trump's campaign team said the media had taken his words out of context and that he did not advocate violence.
In its complaint, Bodini asked the campaign team to compensate for its lax oversight, and also asked Philip to compensate for his attacks, beatings and mental injuries.
Trump spokesman David Hicks did not immediately respond to the news.
Couldn't get in touch with Philip.
Philip left the campaign team in the near future, according to a local news agency in Charlotte.
His consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, did not respond immediately to the call.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign team has been controversial.
Both sides of the case for the Bodini and trump presidential campaign, 16-CS-14300, Mecklenburg County (Charlotte) high court General Court.
Britain must pass the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our communities, London and the country as a whole.
For me, this is the charm of Heathrow, as at the 2012 London Olympics, we do everything we can to ensure that our countries and regions can benefit from these events.
The Olympic Games have benefited Stratford and the eastern district.
And we will benefit the region once again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
In the case of our local community alone, we will create 10,000 new apprentices, 40,000 new jobs and get young people around the airport out of unemployment.
Just as before the London Games in 2012, some people thought Heathrow's expansion was too large.
I was told that Britain would not be ready for the Olympics, and that we would lose face in front of the world.
Skeptics are wrong about the 2012 Olympics, and their doubts about the Heathrow project will prove to be wrong.
While there will always be obstacles that need to be overcome, Heathrow is addressing each of the problems facing them.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority of people, not a minority.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs, generate an economic growth of £, leaving a technical and employment wealth around the airport and across the UK.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team, which has completed the 11 billion pound infrastructure investment project on time and within the budget, including the T5 terminal, which has been elected the world's best airport terminal for five consecutive years, and the T2 terminal between the world's busiest two runways.
Now, they are ready to build a third runway with a private investment of ? ..
The UK successfully hosted the 2012 London Olympics, and I believe that the Heathrow airport expansion project will also be a great success.
It is a good time for us to deliver the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, so that we can escort our future and create a wealth of technology and employment that will make Britain proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the board of directors of Heathrow airport and former business counsellor of the British Treasury
A woman committed suicide on the Swiss highway and was run over
The victim lay on the highway at midnight.
The woman, who tried to kill himself, was run over by several cars on the highway on Thursday morning, and police are looking for witnesses.
The accident took place on the A1 highway near Vaud Morges on Thursday morning.
Vaud police said a woman was "desperately" lying on the road late at night and being run over by a number of cars.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman whose behaviour was clearly suicidal. She was run over by a number of vehicles, including a van.
The woman died on the spot.
Police say a number of drivers have been investigated, but some of the drivers are still not confirmed. Police are calling on them, as well as witnesses to the accident, to come to the investigation.
The Gilles Hofsteiter lawyer told the Geneva Tribune that a criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a routine procedure for such incidents.
But it is not yet known whether a driver will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
"This will be determined by the prosecutor, "he said.
Based on the results of two other similar cases in the past five years, the driver will not be liable.
The two cases were caused by people walking on the highway late at night, according to the newspaper. The final verdict was that the pilot could not expect pedestrians to cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was charged with negligence, alleging that in August 2014, she struck a man on the A1 highway near Payner and killed him.
The court was told that the 22-year-old was drinking drunk and crossing the road.
After the investigation, the judge said the woman's driving was perfectly legal, and the man appeared on the road "completely unexpected and unpredictable" and the policewoman called first aid.
Anyone who can provide information about the accident near Morges on Thursday should contact the police.
NASA climate model: Venus used to be fit for human habitation
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was once fit for human habitation.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space research have developed a model to explore the past of Venus, which uses tools and algorithms that are very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether Venus, with high temperature, no water and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, once had an environment similar to that of the earth.
Previously, scientists thought Venus rotation was slower because it had a thicker atmosphere.
But the latest simulation shows that Venus may have had a thinner, similar to the Earth's atmosphere and that the rotation speed was also slower.
The model can also show the early topography of Venus.
Venus's dry areas may be much larger than the Earth, but there have been enough water and geographic changes to breed life and prevent rapid evaporation.
In the early days, the brightness of sunlight on Venus was darker than that of the earth 30%.
"In a model simulation of the Goddard Institute for Space Research, the slow rotation of Venus has lasted nearly two months on one side, "said Anthony Del Jerneo, a scientist at the Goddard Institute for Space Research at a news conference.
This warms the surface and produces rain that can form thick clouds, and thick clouds are like an umbrella that blocks most of the sun's heat.
The result of the simulation is that the average climate temperature of Venus is actually several degrees lower than the current Earth.
The evolution of Venus, which is simulated by the model, is similar to that of previous planetary scientists.
Although there may have been life on Venus, Venus has been exposed to high temperatures and ultraviolet light in the course of billions of years.
The ocean on the planet evaporates, and the water vapor is burned by ultraviolet light.
With the escape of hydrogen, there is only a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse gas effect, creating the Venus that we know today.
The researchers published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research newsletter.
Patrick Roy resigned as an avalanche team manager
Patrick Roy, who resigned on Thursday as manager and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche ice hockey team, said he had no say in the team's decision-making level.
Joe Sarkis, the managing director of Colorado's executive vice president, confirmed the news and said the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"Over the past three years, I have carried out the duties of the Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president with energy, passion and determination, "Roy, 50, said in a statement.
Throughout the summer, I thought seriously about how to improve the team and make it more powerful.
To this end, the goal of the coach and vice president must be consistent with the goals of the club.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
At present, however, these conditions have not been met.
Sachs hired Roy on May 23, 2013, and he thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," he said.
We thank him for his contribution to the club and hope that he will do well in the future.
Roy was nominated as the best coach of Jack Adams for the first season to coach an avalanche in 2013 - 14.
He helped the club get 112 points, the first in the Central Division, but Colorado was eliminated by the Minnesota team in the first round of the playoffs and missed the playoffs in the last two years.
In the 2015 - 16 season, the avalanche team scored 39 to 39, and ended up losing the second wild card in the western League division by 5 points.
As the -keeper, Roy has won four Stanley Cups, each with two seats for the Montreal Canadian team and the avalanche team.
The North Sea oil field workers stopped the strike and continued to negotiate
The chief negotiator said workers in the North Sea oil field stopped the pay strike and the parties to the dispute began a new round of negotiations.
On the North Sea oil platform operated by Royal Dutch Shell, there have been a number of strikes against the oilfield services company Wood Group.
According to a joint statement, "Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," he said.
We will start with a number of all-day meetings in the coming weeks to re-examine these issues, starting early next week.
The Union said its recent action was to protest the highest possible reduction in 30% of pay, which is the first time the Union has taken this action in 25 years.
Wood Group reduced the remuneration of North Sea contractors by about 9% this year as a result of market pressure.
Prior to the pay cut, the company reduced the remuneration of the maritime contractor by 10% in 2014.
The company said a second pay cut would help the company survive the market slump.
Shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries because of the company's need to streamline its operations after a merger with the British energy company, the British gas group.
Energy companies are under pressure from falling crude oil prices and the UK's decision to leave in June.
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labour dispute in the North Sea generation.
He said the North Sea was vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea and the country as a whole, we need an economy that serves the majority and not the minority, "Dave said in a statement.
In 2016, spending on new projects in the North Sea is not expected to exceed $1.4 billion, compared with an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measured the rotation speed of the stars of the Pleiades star cluster
The Kepler space telescope's latest mission has helped astronomers gather the most complete rotation speed of the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why the stars of the cluster have different rotation speeds, as well as the association between the rotation cycle and the composition of the planet.
"We hope to further understand the relationship between star mass, age, and even the history of the solar system by comparing our results with other clusters, "Luza Raible, a research scientist at the California Institute of Technology's Infrared Processing analysis center, said at a news conference.
The Pleiades cluster is 445 light-years away from the earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and have just reached adulthood.
They have reached the highest rotation speed in their lifetime.
In reaching the highest rotation speed, these mature stars shoot a large number of stellar winds.
When these stellar winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they act as a brake on the stars.
As the age of the star increases, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measured the rotation speed of the stars by tracking the time of the identifiable sunspot (like sunspots).
The latest rotation speed data sets indicate that the larger star's rotation speed is slower than that of smaller stars.
Raible compares stars to dancers, and larger dancers rotate at a slower pace than smaller dancers.
"In the 'ballet performance' in the Pleiades star cluster, we find that stars with slower rotation speed tend to be of greater mass, and the stars with the fastest rotation speed tend to be the lightest stars, "Raible said.
Due to the close proximity of the Pleiades cluster, it can be used as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing stellar mass and rotation speed.
"The Pleiades star cluster lays the foundation for a two-way rotation theory model for young and elderly stars, "Raible said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why the stars slow their rotation and "pick up their dancing shoes."
Raible and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the rotation speed of the Pleiades cluster in three new papers, which will soon be published in the journal Astronomy.
The head of the South Lake park water management section, Zheng Jianjun, said the South Lake is more than 10 meters at the bottom of the water and is likely to be at risk when it is not understood.
"Although the South Lake rescue team is very professional, it is hoped that the vast number of tourists will be able to wear a life jacket, do not do illegal actions on the lake, safe play, "Cheng said.
The Weitou village has the unique marine environment, sits on the natural ecology and the human ecology two major leisure tourism resources.
"But the individual owners who bought the parking spaces, fearing that this would affect the rental price of their parking spaces, also suspect that others have self-interest, so it has been undermined, causing parking to be put on hold. "
There is still a wide variety of views in the academic community about when the sweet potato is introduced by anyone.
In the current more mainstream view, there are three main lines in the introduction of sweet potato.
The most influential and widespread of the three routes introduced by the sweet potato is the introduction of the Philippines to Fuzhou by the Philippines.
The Office of the management of social groups in Beijing will carry out special checks on the use of the unified receipt of contributions from social groups.
The inspection is divided into unit self-examination and key spot checks.
The relevant person-in-charge of the municipal association said that the scope of the inspection included social groups in the city of 2013 to 2015 for the unified receipt of contributions from social groups.
"The success of the Olympics is defined by the people who share stories in social media, "the Rio Organizing Committee said in its 2012 Olympic communication strategy.
According to the report of the Olympic Games, the media have made great changes in the way of communication, product form, language style, news angle and so on.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and media practitioners from all over the world seem to have met the challenge.
On August 11, Everbright Securities H shares went on sale for the last day. It was reported that the market response in the first two days was flat. According to the plan, it would be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 18.
An analyst at a domestic brokerage said that Eastern Securities were not a good base in Hong Kong, and that its capital business was the director of the East Bank. Compared with BOC international, Citic Securities and other banks, it appeared to be a handicap.
Experts say there has been a decline in the performance of many brokerage firms since the return of the securities market this year, but it is impossible to generalize about the development of the company's own business after the company's listing.
After the new deal was introduced, Suzhou will become the first two-line city in the country to restart the sales restriction.
China and other cities such as Hefei and Nanjing are also included in the two-line cities that have introduced or are about to put in place the policy of market regulation.
Hefei has already taken the lead in issuing limited lending policies, and the bank will refuse to provide mortgage services for home buyers who have two apartments in Hefei and have a set of housing loans.
