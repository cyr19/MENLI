The 28-year-old was found dead in San Francisco's shopping mall.
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was discovered this week by a staircase in a local shopping mall.
But the victim's brother said he didn't think anyone would want to kill him, and said "Everything finally got up."
The San Francisco Coroner's office said the body found in the West Tian shopping center in the morning was a 28-year-old residents of Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco police station said the death case was ordered to kill him and was investigating.
KGO, a victim of the victim's Louis Galicia, told American Broadcasting Corp. 's radio station in San Francisco that Frank was ideal for finding a waterline chef in San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago in San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant, said Frank.
A spokeswoman for the Sons & Daughters restaurants said they were "shocked" by Frank's death.
"We're going to be a small team of people with intimate family," said the spokesman. "We'll miss him deeply."
At this time of sorrow, we express our deep sympathy and condolences to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially lived in the reception, but recently "everything is good."
Louis Galicia told KGO: "Frank found an apartment while working with a girl."
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to kill his brother.
Frank has a good-hearted heart and a broad breast.
"Frank is often cooking dinner for family members," said Louis Galicia.
He never wrangled with his family.
He is a person who comes from everyone's opinion.
Louis Galicia said: "Everything in the world is likely to be miserable, but Frank is supposed to be a coarse introvert of a daily luminescence."

Junior doctor strike: Calls for new labour action
The Primary Doctor's representative called on the Union to approve new labour action against new contracts.
The Council of Primary Doctors of the British Medical Association will ask all its members to support more labour action since early September.
The Junior Doctor Committee said the ministers did not resolve the contract.
Junior physicians and medical students voted in July to boycott contracts with the British Medical Association.
Of the members of the vote, 58 per cent opposed the contract.
In a report sent by Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the Committee on Primary Physicians, on Thursday night, the government said the government "always remains silent" on issues that cause a boycott of the contract.
"In view of this, the Executive Committee of the Junior Medicine Commission has voted for the proposed new contract and calls for formal consultations on all concerns," she said.
In response to the silence of the government, the Executive Committee of the Junior Medicine Commission has formally asked the Council of the British Medical Association to convene a special session to approve a long-term plan for the upgrading of labour operations in early September.
The dispute has led primary doctors to participate in six strikes this year, including the first all-round strike in the history of the British National Medical Service.
Dr. Johann Malawana, a primary physician at the British Medical Association, resigned after agreeing to a boycott by the British Medical Association.
In a meeting before a 54,000 primary physician and a medical student, he told members of the British Medical Association that it was a good deal and should therefore be accepted.
After the vote, the health minister, Jeremy Hunt, said that the contract would be enforced in England's healthcare staff.
Russia and Turkey: "Don't you enter the alliance?"
A gesture is ending a crisis.
Russia and Turkey's leaders meet on Tuesday, shaking hands and announcing officially to end up to eight months of mouth warfare and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted Turkey in a glorious Hall of St. Petersburg's palace, I had a strong feeling that the reconciliation was what Ankara would most like to see.
Yes, the two sides shake hands.
However, even according to Mr Putin's benign criteria, Putin is just a shallow smile, almost underestimating the enthusiasm of his enthusiasm.
It was reported that Rejapp Typ Eudoan referred five times to "good friend" Putin.
I couldn't remember it.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia would return to the level before the crisis, even to a higher level.
The next day, one of the newspapers wrote that Mr Erdogan behaved as if nothing had happened.
But I think his enthusiasm implies something opposite to that of the opposite.
However, Mr Putin's persistently cool attitude tells him that nothing is forgotten.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening was the reason for the crisis: Turkey knocked down a Russian warplanes on the Syrian border.
Moscow was a fierce reaction.
Mr Putin has criticized the incident, accusing Ankara of being in the back of Moscow.
It is more difficult to accept the attack from so-called friends.
It is difficult, or even impossible, to re-establish genuine trust.
Russia's public opinion has also been reversed since November.
Over the months, the government-controlled media had made an alarming attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seem to be responsible for all things.
Among them, the most serious is the accusation from senior officials: Mr. Erdogan's family profited from illegal oil deals in the Syrian region controlled by the Islamic state.
He has categorically denied that kind of claim.
However, the message came from St. Pedsburg that it was time to look forward.
After all, the meeting presupposes Putin has received an apology from Turkey's President Erdogan.
Russia can proclaim its victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of truce are obvious.
First, Erdoan, after the coup d'at failed last month, had been driven away, so he needed all his friends.
The mounting terrorist attacks have apparently been a blow to him.
There is also economic motivation.
Russia's sanctions have been a big blow to Turkey, particularly the charter service of millions of Russian tourists a year to the coast of Turkey.
The figures have plunged nearly 90 per cent.
As flights resume, Russia's travel agent is bound to be relieved by the charter company.
They will usher in the late season of the Mediterranean tourist tide.
State television even forecast this week that the price of fruits and vegetables will fall once the imports of Turkish agricultural products are reopened.
"The tourists go and tomatoes come back," said a report of Vedmakosti, a Moscow newspaper.
For Moscow, the visit has an additional political value.
Ankara is angry about the western world's weak response to takeover intentions.
In addition, Mr Ankara is keen to take advantage of political chill and to weaken Turkey's relations with the Western world with slow progress in the EU talks and Mr Putin's inclination.
As a result of the failure of the coup d'at, Russian leaders will be given an increase in Ankara.
Note that this is a gift that has always been a gift for Moscow's deep-rooted fear of regime overlap.
As a result, meetings held at the magnificent seaside palace enabled Russia to align itself with two of Turkey's rejection of abusive nations, an analyst describing it as "a coalition."
However, despite public reconciliation, there are still significant differences between both sides.
Syria is one of the key factors. Moscow has played a role in Syria in Syria, and Russia and Turkey support the opposite factions.
It could be foreseen that after nearly three hours of preliminary conversations, the two presidents said at the briefing that the subject had not yet been discussed.
The Turkish President has deliberately avoided questions about the differences between the two sides, while Mr Putin emphasised.
The two sides have not reached a clear consensus on how to shelve differences on the Syrian issue.
It is certainly a good thing for leaders of the two countries to restart their dialogue once again in the months of open hostility and the triggering of large catastrophes in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation member States.
RBS will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
Banks will be simplified as a logistics sector, according to RBS's chief executive.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve clients outside Scotland.
Royal Bank of Scotland has been committed to its global ambition, Royal Bank of Scotland has told the British Broadcasting Corporation.
But when it came to collapse eight years ago, the bailout began to give up the pursuit of that pursuit.
In that time, brand strategist uses "RBS" to protect other consumer financial brands.
The group has spent millions of pounds sponsoring international sporting events to sponsor Rugby's six-nation championships and Winbleton championships, Andy Murray.
But now, right now, the right approach is to make more national brands come out of the corner.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but will not return it.
In England and Wales, it will be changed to the National Westminster Bank, both at Headquarters and on the stock exchange.
The Alst brand has been used for clients in the Irish and Northern Ireland Autonomous Region.
Other higher-profile private banking brands, such as takeover banks, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank, are there for other higher-profile private-banking brands.
Mr McEne has been interviewed in an interview with employees in Innesshire's customers.
"The Royal Bank of Scotland will eventually become our investor brand, as well as one of the employees of employees, because we have become a bank with a lot of brands," he told the BBC Scot.
Since the bank itself becomes an international brand, RBS is also a global brand.
Now, I'm going to say that we are no longer focused on the world, and we have turned our eyes to the home.
Each brand represents the different sectors of the industry, and our staff are serving clients through different brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland has shown no continuation of the six-nation tournament, while efforts have been made to boost the image of different brands in sports events.
"It's time to become a multi-branded bank because privately we have been exploring how to become a better service to customers," the chief executive said.
If we decided three years ago to become a big bank with a large number of brands, it would be sarcastic.
At present, we focus on customer needs, and I believe you have taken note of these changes.
I think we can restart these brands, and now the time is right.
Dai Kathu won a career 3,000 victory on the success of Mr Numkitt's success.
The two triumphant victories in Newmarkite won the career 3,000 win, followed by champagne champagne celebration.
On Friday, Frankie Detori, a professional racekeeper, won his 3000 victories at Newmarket.
He was in a hurry to learn from Predilection, the hand of John Gosden, to win two triumphs in the night, and to achieve a career of 3,000.
The 45-year-old Italians were the sixth professional racetrack for the milestone in the field in the field.
The top five were Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pt Eddy and Wille Carson.
Datu, the three championships who won the Gayyar victory in Ghaayar, said: "This is special."
I'm excited because my family also is on the scene too.
I was delighted with my achievements in Newmarkite, which I started out of here 30 30 years ago.
It is not a big racing club, nor Royal Ashot, that is a common Friday night with 20,000 spectators.
I am very gratified, also humble.
Dai Kuturei took over the Privacy after the victory, aroused the whole hail.
In the obstacle, two riders made this achievement, with Sir Richard Johnson, a champion of the championship, Richard Johnson, and now the retired 20th champion, Sir McCoy, who scored more than 4,300 victories in his record-breaking career, Sir Richard Johnson and now the retired 20-champion championship, Sir Michael McCoy.
Pepsi was the nine-race champion, with a total of 4,493 triumphs in his career.
Dai Tui is one of the best riders in times of time, so it's not surprising that he won this milestone, and it's not a lot of a success for him before.
He was fashionable and bumped, but it was his tactical rationality that he really made him stand out in the weight-weighted room.
He was an ambassador of equestrian equestrian, his enthusiasm and charm for the campaign, attracting a lot of fans over the years.
A few weeks ago, I told Digu in Epsom that if he was not just a weekend, he should have been able to get 6,000 triumphs!
Really, Datu is too important to say that the best equestrian winner in the thirty years of the UK is too important.
His character is lively, it is a good thing for the British races, but in addition, he is an incredible jockey.
Dai Tui, with its signature leaps, celebrates the milestone to celebrate this milestone.
From the jumping line to jumping down the horse, Datu has always been a classic representative in Britain's peace field for twenty years.
He's a roller coaster, like a roller coaster.
He won a number of championships, including the famous "Seven Competition" in the Royal Esko Cosko in 1996, but he also encountered crash incidents, as well as a ban on taking a ban on drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned to the playground after his six-month forbidden period, he had shown an amazing personality advantage and finally returned to the peak, giving the sceptical man the best of his scepticism.
He might not have been too long - he had said before, he hoped he would be able to participate at least 50 years before the age of 50.
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the Director of the Chair Ivanov office office.
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly lifted the office of the president of the president of Sergei Ivanov, the president of the presidential office.
Mr Ivanov has been a part of the core group that Mr Vladimir Mr Putin trusted for years.
Mr. Ivanov, 63 years old, has been appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transportation.
A statement by the Kremlin said Mr. Putin had "announced the release of the Director of the Russian Presidential Office of the Russian President Ivanov," but did not give reasons.
Anton Vaino, who began serving as Mr Ivanov's deputy in 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr. Waito is 44 years old and is a former diplomat.
He was born in 1972 in Tallin, the capital of the Estonian capital, and graduated from the famous Moscow National Relations Institute, which worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he manages the draft presidential and government staff, the Kremlin website (Russian language use).
After he was appointed, he said to Mr. Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of this Government is to support the Head of State drafting laws and control orders.
Mr. Vladimir Putin told Russian television Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself asked to resign and recommend Mr. Vaino to take over.
Such a smile is convincing?
Moscow was uncertain about this move.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Putin's closest assistants, as well as Putin, as well as the Soviet Security Agency (KGB).
As Director of the Office, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
At a meeting with President Vladimir Putin on National Television, two people were said to have asked the office to resignate themselves.
Although smiling in front of the camera, almost no one convinces - especially at the time of parliamentary elections.
So, is it the result of defeat in some sort of power contest?
There is no way out.
But official claims - a candidate who has been regarded as a presidential candidate - has led to a great deal of suspicion that he has chosen to hold Russia's environmental policy.
"Yes, early 2012," he said, quoting Mr. Ivanov's dialogue with Mr. Vladimir Putin, "yes, in early 2012, I asked you to give me this difficult position, even in a troublesome position, for four years."
"The result is that I have been the president of the presidential office for four years," he said.
Mr. Ivanov held his post in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council, as well as Mr Putin, as well as a former member of the National Security Bureau.
At the end of the 1990s, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy, when Mr Putin became the Federal Security Agency (FSB) head of the National Security Agency.
After Mr. Putin took up, he appointed Mr Ivanov to one of his most trustworthy five.
Mr Ivanov, who once thought Mr Ivanov might be a Russian president after the second term of Mr Putin, was a violation of the constitution.
But the post eventually belonged to Dmitry Medvedev, another close assistant to Vladimir Putin.
Before returning to the presidency three and a half years later, Mr. Putin served as Prime Minister of Russia.
A mysterious fish startled at Bancf Gardens
A resident of Banff found a fish startled at his own garden, and then made a request for help.
Kevin Bain believes the 75 fish may be the saloons that are scraped by the sea tornado.
Mr Bain, where Mr Bain lived at about 500 metres from the sea, released a video on the odd scene in Periscope, hoping someone could explain why he could explain the two inches of the fish.
Kunsfei Bridge has now been reached to Fafe.
The project planned to be completed in May 2017 was completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the north bridges of Queensfry Crossing and the admittance bridges, meaning the bridge is now crossing to Faff.
The dragon, which is located near the three bridges of Bridge Bridge, is now close to completion, and the project is the first bridge of the bridge.
Starting from Fafe, the bridge is 600 meters and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It uses 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 sticks of slanting.
The project, which is $1.33 billion, is completed in May 2017.
Keith Brown, the economics minister, visited the scene today as one of the first people to boarder the bridge.
"This is a historic moment in the construction of the Kunsfei Bridge," he said.
We are all witnessing engineering operations in such grandiose projects that have used more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel in this section of the bridge.
Although the size and weight of the bridge is enormous, the dragons between the bridges and bridges need to be finely operated, requiring very precise assemblies.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridal faces have been installed, and the concrete bridge facing the last section of the bridge is pouring in Rosyth, that is, all the bridges are ready to be ready.
"Whatever the bridge project, the first dragon is a major milestone," says Michael Martin, director of company project construction at Quinsfei Bridge.
As far as this remarkable project is concerned, the dragon shows the forefront of civil engineering technology.
After installation of the last pavement board and connecting it to the enlarged North Bridge boards, then you need to complete the remaining shortages of the north or near the surface of the land.
The operation needs to remove 700 millimetres south of the northern overhead bridges.
It was a huge operation, and it was a very sophisticated homework.
It is a huge size because it is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 tonnes, and it needs to pull out about 3% of the slope.
It is so sophisticated because engineering teams need to make sure the deviation is very small and only a few millimetres each side.
To be comforted, all progress has gone smoothly.
Simon Bayes picked the women gymnastics championship champion
Forget the stress.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles was not influenced by all this.
The jump is full of vitality.
The balance of equilibrium wood can be used.
Free gymnastics movement was amazing.
The overall performance is very good.
Now, at last, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast picked up a full championship on Thursday and showed her talent for the world's gymnastics in the Olympic Games.
She has a total distance of 62.198 from Aly Raisman and the bronze winner Aliya Mustafina as well as the "Final Five" player, the Final Five group, and the bronze medal Russia鈥檚 Russian-owned Russian-owned Russian-owned Russian-owned Russians.
Simon Byles, from Simon Byles, the United States, carried out a balanced wooden performances during the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bayes helped the American team achieve four corners of the women's gymnastics gymnastics, and she won five medals in the Games, further confirming that she was the generation, and the best gymnastics.
When he saw the moment of his general division, Byles couldn't help but shed tears. She finally ended this long journey.
Whereas Byles was among the "decades of athletes" like Michael Phelps, who elevated sports projects in their respective fields to new heights:
Byls has scored 15 world championships for the last three years, including 10 gold medals, with her daily training to achieve higher precision. In 1984, Mary Lou Retton, the Olympic champion of 1984, said: "Byrs is the best gymnast I've ever seen."
There has been a last match in Brazil, but the game is not so much the competition between Byles and other gymnastics, as it is between herself and the great expectations of the gymnast.
If Byls had not been full of gold medals to her home in Splin in Texas, everyone would be disappointed.
Simon Bayus, from the United States, was embraced with Lesman, who won gold and silver medals at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Byrs took the first gold medal Tuesday, offering a pleasant gift to the ex-retired national coach Carolina Karolyi.
Although Byles insists that he does not plan the future in the year of the championship of the championship, it is not entirely true.
One part of the Bai-free gymnastics game, including her signature thrust chain, was the Latin music, and the music was often heard in the vicinity of a street with the Rio Olympic venue.
It's no coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by his grandparents, who was adopted by her grandparents at a gymnasium in a gymnasium, was now a strong force at the time of a visit by her mother, Aimee Borman.
Since the summer of 2013, Byles did not lose his hands in the all-powerful game, but she would win, as long as he wanted to win.
Mustafa's two sprawling turns out to be just a hallucination.
The defending world champion of the defending world championship and free-gymnastics in two projects.
Her balance wood scores 15.433, free gymnastics score 15.933.
While waiting for final paraphrase, Lesman gently gently embraced Byles. When Byles learned that he had dreamed of a dream, he left tears in his eyes.
Lesman's performance was a bit like revenge for four years, when she was third, but she lost to Mustafa in the victorious office.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, who has been called "Grandma" by Americans, is far ahead.
She kissed the crowd at the end of liberal gymnastics, proclaiming a return, but it seemed to be doubtful.
Byles was 19 years old. As early as this week, the news was spread like a Twitter virus, and his life had been given new significance for Byles.
The 6-year-old Mahaj Brown, a six-year-old Mahaj Brown in Philadelphia, survived in Philadelphia.
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, a six-year-old child shot in the second half of the city this week.
The child's grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the gunshot child was Mahaj Brown.
The Brown's grotesque, legs, arms and abdomen were wound, they said, but the child was awake on the way to deliver a medical doctor.
"He got a lot of sin, the small body was hit badly by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez said to the television station.
I couldn't believe it.
The boy was critical in the hospital and had received a number of surgeries.
His family told television that the child was expected to recover.
He was originally beginning to read the first grade in a local elementary school.
Brown is one of the four men who have been shot in the German-in-town.
Among those who had been shot, two were 29 years old and a 32-year-old man.
One of the 29 years of victims was critical, according to CBS Philadelphia, and the other two victims were stable.
Television said the child and the 29-year-old victim were found in front of the car in front of the car.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police were investigating a gunman who was investigating the injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it seemed like a number of gunmen crossed the fire.
The scene found a number of shells of offensive weapons, which could be inferred that they were used in different offensive weapons.
As a result, this is undoubtedly a continuing battle.
There has been a shell on both sides of the street.
"So there are a number of armed men in the scene at the time," said Anthony Ginaldi, chief policeman of Philadelphia, to television stations.
Many homes and vehicles are damaged in the region.
It is said that the police are looking at surveillance video, which has not been carried out.
On Tuesday, a six-year-old child (girl) was shot in her arm when playing at her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhoods.
She is now recovering and police are still hunting for suspects.
Why we need Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie
I would like to evaluate this year's Olympic gymnastics team for more than one reason.
First, since 1984, I went to every Summer Olympic Games, but the United States had never assumed the dominance of its dominance.
Second, the gymnast has three excellent gymnasters, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Herndez, who have been inspired by a large number of colourful girls.
The composition of the team would be proud of all of them, for there was an emblem of Judaism, Aly Raisman and Madison Kitan of the Catholic.
The team finally looked at the U. S. team.
It has also reinforced the pinnacle of black and Latino women in the movement.
Over the past four years, the first-ever female gymnast athletes have been African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabrielle were ranked first, second.
It was so terrible.
The last Olympic Games, Gabriel Douglas, "unexpectedly" became a champion of the Olympic Games, cheering the United States.
Nowadays, the world can witness three world championships, Douglas, Douglas and Laurie Ernandez, who portray the conventional gymnastics skills as divinely deductible.
On Thursday, Simon helped the U. S. team achieve a four-crown on a woman's all-round program.
Her teammate Ali Lesman had silver medals in the silver medal.
We boarded the peak of the movement, but it was not in the American gymnastics teaching class.
Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie's access to Olympic teams are like Ali and Madison.
They are the Final Five-group group, because the next Olympic gymnast will consist of four gymnast players, which is the last year of Marta Karolyi's last year.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a costly exercise, mainly at the private gymnastics club, and their parents need to pay training, facilities, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (including coaches and gymnast and family members), and the cost list is still increasing.
Most gymnastics clubs are located in a rich suburb of support for the industry.
All of the gymnast's training is completed at these clubs and is a long-term cost for the gymnast's family.
Byrs's coach Aimee Boorman and Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have been teaching them since the gymnast began to practice gymnastics.
We must bring more pragmatic, more achievable gymnastics training to young girls affected by Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie.
I set up my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organization, we are providing free and cheap gymnastics to more than 15,000 young people in the black neighborhood (mostly black and Hispanic Americans), and cultivating the country and the world champion.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to those who deserve this learning opportunity and will benefit from the inferior Olympic movement.
Gymnastics helps to cultivate the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and help cultivate hard work, self-discipline and determination.
These can lead to life-long benefits for a person's health, education and work.
Encouraged by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, and this is really great.
Participating in the movement is significant, especially for girls.
It's a moment of exciting moments.
Thanks to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabrielle and Madison in winning the "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic group's gold medals, they also thanked them for inspiring young girls with such diverse backgrounds to open their way to healthy, powerful and successful ways.
After dismissing Jeremy Hunt's proposal, Junior Doctor plans to launch further strike.
The ministers initially hoped to end the dispute by accepting a modified contract with the British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior junior doctors opposed the contract.
In July, Mr. Hunt revealed plans to impose a contract, saying the country's National Medical Service (NHS) is currently in a "vacuum zone" and a minor delay would hurt employees' and patients' interests.
The new contract refers first to the modification of the practice practices of primary doctors and weekends to improve the care of unnormal working hours.
Last night, Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Junior Physicians Committee, said in a statement: "Primary doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially fear that it will exacerbate the current labour crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
It is only eight weeks left for the first physician to sign a new contract, and we need to make progress, not much time.
BMA struggled to resolve disputes through negotiations, but it was unwilling to participate, sometimes with silence at the government.
Nonetheless, last month we got Jeremy Hunt's promise, and he said his door was always open.
"Jeremy Hunt now needs to take action to cancel mandatory execution and address the concerns of a primary physician.
If he did not do it, the primary physician made it clear that they were ready to take further labour action.
The last strike took place at the end of April, resulting in a total of 13,000 routine surgery and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and consulting doctors cover the care of doctors on the track.
The ministers initially hoped to end the dispute by accepting a modified BMA contract.
BMA hopes to get a better weekend salary for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employees, called for a junior doctor to do no more than any other strike.
Mr Mortimer said: "There has been a minimal impact on labour operations, which will cause pressure on people, nurses and their families to worry, worry and disrupt their families."
In the past two months, we have continued to negotiate with the Junior Medicine Committee, with a positive response to the role of guardianship and reporting of the role of guardians.
Employers would like to continue to actively explore other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility and other training, training costs, common cognitions for post-career interruptions, common cognition of the curriculum, common cognition of curricula and gender wage differentials in the areas of education and medical treatment, and the Ministry of Health attaches great importance to agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A Heart Thermal Seizure Reduced a Heart Seizure a day
Officials are proposing to popularize a pound of two pounds a day to more patients and to lengthen the medication time, and thousands of patients will benefit from the drug.
The risk of refreshing heart disease in patients with heart disease can be reduced by anti-coagulate drugs.
The drug, which lasted 12 months after heart attacks, could reduce the risk of a stroke or a second attack on heart disease.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Optimization (NICE) of the British National Medical Service System (NHS) recommended that patients continue to take four years of medicine to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But NICE, the NICS regulator, has recommended that the patient continue to take four years of medicines to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people have suffered heart disease every year, with a quarter of them continuing to experience a recurrence of heart disease or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are the result of fatty substances in the arterial wall deposition.
If the plaque disconnects, it causes thrombosis to hinder blood flow into the heart, causing heart attack.
If thrombosis moves, it will enter blood flow, hindering blood flow into the brain, causing stroke.
Patients who have experienced a heart attack have increased the risk of a second attack on heart disease.
Credit Gray was manufactured by AstraZeneca, the UK company, to sell the name of the commodity, which could reduce risk by reducing the formation of thrombosis.
The NICE guidelines, published today, recommend that patients take 90 mg for 12 months and take 60 mg of kilograms and two aspirin a day after three years.
"Despite effective secondary prevention treatment, there are up to a quarter of those who have a heart attack history again or stroke, often causing serious consequences," says Prof. Carole Longgson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre (NICE Health & Technology).
Fear of relapse would have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Evidence shows that, with aspirin and aspirin, the risk of disease recurrence and stroke in patients experiencing heart attacks can be effectively reduced.
We are deeply gratified that the temporary recommendation for Kakray will provide more therapeutic choices for thousands of people who benefit from it.
The draft was not proposed to continue to use its treatment after that period, because of the limited information about the efficacy and safety of KCGGG in three years.
Computer culture makes "election fraud" prevalent in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, has been prompted by corruption last year, prompting a government report to be published.
"Political correctness" has led to widespread electoral fraud that prevailed in Muslim communities, and the anti-lethal government reported today that it was so unclear.
Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet minister, blamed police, electoral regulators and city hall for "over-sensitivity to racial segregation and religious issues" as evidence of abuses of elections.
The former community affairs minister, incumbent on his incumbent, said that the practice of intimidating voters by religious positions has affected badly and police should be allowed to set up a police cordon outside the polling station to protect the alarming voters.
He suggested that the electorate carry identification documents to confirm his identity.
At present, the electorate needs only to report his name and address.
The report even suggests the coating of unbroken ink on the voter's fingers to prevent a bouquet of votes.
Sir Eric said the protection of the reporters should be intensified.
He called for increased media awareness of the decisions of the Conference documents and the unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not just to guard against election fraud, or to protect local governments from wide-ranging corrupt culture, as well as the financial fraud with which they are closely linked," he said.
The report was issued after the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London, demanding that Downing Street be issued.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that a string of corruption and illegal acts in the mayor of Lahmann should be dismissed.
The court found that Rahman "abuses" the religious sentiment of the Muslim community and is closed to the sword's allegations of racial discrimination and Islamic phobia.
It is said that Rahman, "in the campaign, declared his vote as a religious duty of faithful Muslims."
The suspicion of up to 300 ballot papers is likely to be a vote for voters.
Sir Eric said there was evidence that there was an electoral fraud across the country.
He warned of mailing election fraud, and said senior members of the Muslim community were putting pressure on voters to vote for candidates who were appointed by them.
Sir Eric (in photographs) on a number of proposals to clean up the voting mechanism, including the identification of his identity cards to confirm his identity as proof of his identity.
"The evidence shows that senior members, especially those in the background of Pakistan and Bangladesh, are putting pressure on vulnerable groups in minority communities, especially women and young people, to vote on their own wishes," he said.
"Because of ethnic segregation and religious" political correctness, "they worry that national institutions will be blind to such behavior."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the electoral mechanism, including a strictly forbidden political activist to deal with the mailing paper to prevent "voting harvest."
The report also calls for strict registration of information to prevent the registration of voters from being used for immigration and welfare fraud. The report is also being considered by Thresa May.
These proposals include asking voters to produce identification cards before polling.
After voting on the voter's fingers, the wrapped ink to prevent a boutique vote.
Systematic verification of the nationality of the electorate is to ensure the voting qualification.
The validity period for automatic mailing requests shall be fixed for three years.
Political activists and militants are forbidden to handle completed mailing voting and mailing envelopes.
Authorize police to set up a guard line around the polling station.
Amendment of legal provisions makes it easier to suspend crimes in accordance with the Republika Act 1983 (1983) of the People's Representative of the People's Representative of the People's Republic of China.
It is illegal to take photos at polling stations.
Provision is made for the polling station in English (except in the Wales area).
Enhanced training to ensure that staff strictly implement the provisions of the "electorate alone".
Sir Eric rebuked the Metropolitan Police, saying it was "amazed" that they did not propose any criminal charges after the Tower Hamlets incident.
"There has been a lot of corruption and unlawful behavior in Rahman and its electoral officers," he said.
In accordance with the standard of criminal certification, he is indisputable in many ways.
He also criticized the "checkbox" of the "checklist" of the city hall electoral registration department.
"Last year the court gave a warning bells to the Tower Hamlets," Sir Erik said.
My country has a glorious tradition of "the mother of parliament," but some of the privately self- witted electoral fraud and its aftermath are a cause for concern and a threat to this good reputation.

The CBC Olympic Speaker apologized for "slower pig" comments on Chinese swimmers
On Wednesday, Byron MacDonald's fourth comment on the fourth-x-200m freestyle Freestyle Restoration of Women's 4x200 freestyle relay was irritated by the broadcast of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Olympic Games on Wednesday.
A spokesman for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation CBC says the 14-year-old Chinese swimming will be in the race to swim faster than the stench in the game, and the CBC has been forced to apologize after the CBC was forced to apologise.
The commentator, Byron McDonald, gave her own opinion at the end of the 4x200 freestyle relay race, when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
"The 14-year-old Chinese young girl made a stupid mistake," said Mr. Byron, who heard the CBC Napoleon's team with a "tinky spectacle" commentator.
As it was too excited, he began to swim faster than the stench, but later looked as slow as a pig.
But it was thanks for her.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Yahoo, who is 14-year-old, has a second batch of 7, 57 seconds, behind a 1.61 seconds in Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allows Canadians to shrink the gap with China.
The whole Canadian audience was shocked by the tone and wording of the commentator, after which they quickly reacted on the network.
Emmittt Macflane said: "The CBC commentator says the Chinese 14-year-old swimmer" slower like a pig "??
The idiot was not aware of the live broadcast.
Chinese Xiaoyu, who took part in the 4x200 freestyle freestyle race, was described as saying: "The 14-year-old Chinese young girl made a stupid mistake."
Twitter's criticism of Byron McDonald was swiftly on the pitch, and a lot of people asked him to withdraw from it.
When the Twitter user heard that Byron McDonald's reaction was retarded, they did not take it.
"says another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote," Wow, Byron McDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and your words make all of us sound like a group of racist races. # It is really annoying.
Soon afterwards, CBC radio host Scott Russell apologized in the direct broadcast, saying: "We apologize for the performance of the swimming swimmer."
"We apologize for this untimely wording," he said.
More than 90 times the CBC apologizes to the Twitter users who respond to the speech.
Another commentator, Scott Russell, also apologized for Byron.
After the CBC, they copy their apologies to the more than 90 of the more than 90 Twitter Twitter users.
The channel was also quick to apologize and released a statement.
We feel immensely sorry to say that, and to live straight out of it.
Last night, we took quick action to apologize to our audience, as well as to pay attention to our audience in social media.
What needs to be explained is that Byron's explanation is that the swimmer's performance is not to be directed against her personally.
That is, wording is really inappropriate, and Byron deeply sorry for it.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized in the direct broadcast, he said he did not mean a half-bit of personal attack, and tried to make his speech.
"I'd like to take some time to apologize for my remarks after the end of the relay in the women's race last night," he said on the CBC Olympics.
"I just comment on the performance of swimming swimmers, not against their individuals."
"Of course, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
Primark, a woman who is brazen in the middle of a shop in the middle of the store, says anger is anger.
A woman was at the center of a Primark store in the middle of a Pripark store, where the shopkeeper did not know where to see it.
Worse still, she also looked at how she was wearing, and then put her underwear off the shelf.
She continued to browse through the shelves and eventually tested four underwear in the store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall at Folkestone.
The woman is experimenting in the Primark shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, then put back the shelf again.
In the shop, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children, said the mysterious woman was "dressed once again, and then went out of the shop and didn't buy anything."
"Everybody dares not to believe what they see," she said.
She was standing in the middle of the store, taking off a pair of underwear from the shelf, taking off her tight pants and underwear, and then put it on it.
"She did not try to find the hidden place," she said. "She was just standing there. It was so shameless."
"When she took off her underwear again, all the people were startled, apparently, she was not satisfied, because she put her underpants back on the shelf."
Afterwards, she tried three, and finally found that it was not like herself, and then dressed again, and went out of the shop.
"She doesn't seem to care if someone is looking at her - or who doesn't think who will finally buy her a painted underwear."
"It feels sick," said Ms. Davidson, who lives in Kent town, and says, "I think someone is going to buy someone else who passes through and unwashed the underwear."
That happened Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "After she left, the store clerk was clearly going to handle the underwear for the underpants."
"I hate buying a new pair of underwear in home, but I find another woman trying to get through and have not been cleaned."
"Primark has known that Aug. 9 (Tuesday) took place in our Folkestone store," a Primark spokeswoman said.
All the problematic commodities have been put down.
How to use horsemanship to protect themselves in a gun attack
The world is dangerously dangerous, but the video on Dailymail.com may bring you a bit of a sense of security.
We asked Rhon Mizrachi, master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, to know how to tackle the murderer at close distance.
Whether he is from the front, or next to you, the video will teach you how to be defeated.
If the gunman nears you from behind, the first thing you want to do is turn around, so you can see the attacker and "clear the fire," says Mizrachi.
Then fasten the gun with the forearm and shoulders, and use your elbow to beat the attacker's face.
Then, when the attacker bent down with pain, reversing his gun, using a gun tube and a back-up gun, keeping his arms on his face, kept his arms on him.
If the gunman is nearing the front, using similar techniques - let your body not in the fireline, seize guns and reverse the gun so that gunmen can't fire fire.
At the same time, the weight weighed on the gun and hit the attacker's chest, reversing the muzzle from his tight hand and then at his mouth.
"It sounds complicated.
Look at the video to see how the Mizrachi is doing.
But remember, if you're not the masters of horsemanship, want to get rid of robbery, the safest way is to surrender cash.
A rogue family destroyed in Cornwall's Shottash of Cornwall in front of a discrete family.
One of the rogue families who scared the neighbour's expulsion from their neighbors, destroying it before leaving the house, causing a loss of 50000 pounds.
After a long string of complaints, Tanya Skeldon, his husband, Shaun Trebilcock, was driven out of a low-rental house in Solttash, Cornwall.
After being forced to leave the house, the Housing Association officials were surprised to find that there was a serious destruction here.
The walls were filled with holes, the floor was torn, and the garbage was thrown full of rubbish, and the walls were mess.
After being exported, the family had been moved and said it was now living in private housing.
Donna McEvoy, a housing manager at Cornwall Housing Society, said she was afraid that the house could not be saved.
"For people living here, this is a nightmare," she said. "I don't think people can live like this."
There are now many things that need to be weighed, because the house is likely to be a little less than a good element in Cornwall.
The family was notorious, and their names were notoriously notoriously infamous.
The couple had three sons. Police said the family's terror included using baseball sticks in the streets, intimidating neighboring residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, screaming, bickering, and cursing.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant named Skeldon received a resolution on anti-social behavioural.
In the house that could be demolished, many rooms were placed for a long time of garbage.
In the room where there was a drug-traded room, the floor was thrown up.
Neighbors say they often find themselves fighting on the street, often to alarm police.
After an 11-week extension for them to move voluntarily, the Cornwall Housing Society forced her to leave her husband with her husband this week.
At last the breathtaking neighbors were cheering for this, saying that the previous life was a hell of hell.
"They don't care about anyone," said one neighbor.
We have been living next door for 20 years and have been so bad.
We had seen the policemen on numerous occasions.
"We couldn't sleep this morning," he said.
We got up early in the morning, because we were too quiet here - we were not used to it.
It was very good for them to go at last.
'This family didn't work well with local governments, 'says Adam Fitzpatrick, a community executive manager at Cornwall's housing association.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, and the police often visited the house.
garbage and old toys were thrown on one side of the low-rent hut.
He added: "It is unfortunate that the tenant has no responsibility for her and her family, expulsion is the final consideration of the Cornwall Housing Society."
This is a very difficult case, because their behavior is extremely extreme, and what they do is to make the neighbors feel terribly frightened.
I thank my team for the work they have done, and thank the members of the Cornwall police as well as the community who brave us to provide information to us.
I hope that the move will give a little consolation to the neighbors and send a message that we don't tolerate anti-social behaviour.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said their three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all over 20 years old.
After they were driven away, one of the bedroom floors also threw a dirty mattress on the floor.
Housing Association workers will soon clean up the garbage around the house.
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, and found a flat, drug-utensil and 1,700 pounds of cash.
After guilty, Skeldon imposed a fine on the possession of B-class drugs and drug trafficking intentions.
She claims that money is used to buy a tombstone for her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013, who died of car accidents.
It is understood that, after homeless, Tanya is now living with his husband in a private house in Plymouth.
All the walls of the house had been painted with graffiti.
Police said they would expulsion the tenants of the tenant rules.
The expulsion sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to disobey the tenant rules, according to Angela Crow, of Cornwall's police station.
"The warning is that those who think their actions will not be blamed, as well as those who have been tortured by such acts," she said.
Devon and Cornwall's police force will never tolerate crime and anti-social behaviour, and they will continue to work together to protect our community.
Reed: Hillary, if elected president, will nominate Garland to enter the Supreme Court.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said he would nominate Merrick Garland Judge Merrick Garland to enter the Supreme Court if Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was elected president.
Senate Republicans have been halting the confirmation of Garland since the nomination of President Barack Obama in March to nominate Germans.
Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, said the next president would pick the man to replace Antonin Scalia, the late Supreme Court judge.
At a conference call Thursday, Reid said he predicted that Hillary would choose to "have some credibility" of Garland.
A spokeswoman for Reed later said Reid didn't talk to Hillary about whether he would nominate Grande and said he was just guessing.
He admired Garland and said Hillary's team did not want to be "agitated" because of the new choice.
Garland was the chief judge of the Confederate Troop Court in Columbia.
Mr Reid says that the Republican nominee for Rand's nomination is the "favourite" and "accomplisher" of the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't fit for the president.
"Treats": Naked Calendar "Both men and women love"
Treats magazine will work together with photographer David Belleme to shoot a set of inspiration from the 2017 calendar of Pirelli in the 20th century.
This time they plan to look for a new generation of top models for its 2017 NU Muses calendar, rather than the famous naked nude.
Steve Shaw, chief executive of Treats, said earlier this year that they were different from the old-fashioned magazine "Playboy", because "the latter is looking for men."
And we are looking for women.
Obviously, he thought that the calendar was also true.
"We need to show an eternal and classic nude that makes women and men feel comfortable, and this is inspired by this," Shaw said at a calendar of a calendar.
Women would be happy to take part in the film because it was a beautiful art.
Models can be presented online for photographs and can be recruited to Los Angeles and New York for public recruitment.

The French Court dismissed petitions from stores in the jungle camp.
A French court dismissed a petition by the Galai government to dismantle dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the "jungle" camp, where thousands of refugees are currently living in the camp.
At the Court's hearing this week, the government argued that the French government should have the right to dismantle 72 makeshift stores in the camp, selling products from cigarettes to energy-drinking-drinks and offering haircut services for 50 cents (40 pence) in makeshift restaurants and selling basic meals at a cost of 50 cents (40 pence) in makeup restaurants or a few euros selling basic meals.
The Galai governor's office believes that these places should be dismantled because they are not a parallel economy, and there are fire and health hazards.
The humanitarian community has shown that these shops and restaurants are extremely important to the Court, since the free food provided by the state-supported associations and other groups cannot meet the needs of the growing refugee camps in the camps.
These makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those who need it, they say.
A court court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the operator of 72 temporary stores, but said the worries of the Governor of Galai were "fully understood".
Judge Jean Franceis Molla says the role of these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants is far more than simply providing food to refugees who "live under extremely dangerous conditions."
'These are the peaceful convergence points between refugees and volunteers, 'he said.
One of the dismantling threats is the camp's Jungle Book Kids cafe, which provides 200 food, English and French lessons a day, offering asylum advice to hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the refugee camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to protect the cafe.
In a letter to Guardian, the closure of the cafe "will be a catastrophe of these children who are only eight years old."
The two charity groups, Help Refuges and L'Abuerge des Migants, predicted Friday that the number of refugees in the jungle camp has exceeded 9,000, the highest level since the surge in summer refugee numbers.
"The $5,000 is to be financed," he said. "It's my eyebrow."
Yi Fen has received the University of Nanhua University Recadadation Notices, the poor building of the Pyramid Village.
Just as she was worried about the cost of admission, on August 9, the county council gave her $5,000 to pay for her.
In the past few days, the departments concerned also put in place a total of over 690 poverty-stricken students who have funded the study.
At the same time, it is especially difficult for the family's economic situation to help them complete their studies by organizing society to donate money aid.
Prices this year converted more than 18.5 million yuan in funding to finance the real bank card in poor students in accordance with the prescribed time-limit.
She said thankfully, "I thought Dad was dead, and my brother and I didn't have a big school, I didn't expect the county to solve the difficulties in time."
As of Aug. 8, there were 1,140 poverty-stricken students implemented in the first half of this year over 2.1 million yuan.
All the impoverished students in the county are eligible to help, supplement the supplement.

In the early days of the Beijing "Residence Permit" rules, this means that "temporary evidence" will escalate into "residence permits."
Relevant authorities say the shift from "temporary evidence" to "Residence Permit" means that Beijing will shift from management to multi-directional services from "management" to the non-permanent resident population of Beijing.

"Environmental problems are manifested in the atmosphere, water and soil pollution, but the roots are still in the production lifestyle."
In 2015, for example, land development in Jiangsu province has reached 21 percent, the highest number of provinces and autonomous regions.
Therefore, the problems of high pollution, large energy and more occupancy have not yet been fundamentally addressed in the production of lifestyles.
On the one hand, the result of the creation of the ecological environment at all levels of Jiangsu Province is the first place in the country; on the other hand, the resource environment is underbearing.
To promote the protection and improvement of eco-environmental protection, it is necessary to fundamentally push forward the transformation of productive lifestyles, promote the transition to an ecologically civilized development.

Qingdao is the country's first pilot city in Shandong Province and the first pilot city in Shandong Province.
On 11 December, many enterprises came to the Qingdao Sewage Rights Trading Centre to submit requisition for pollutant discharge rights and to pay compensation fees after accepting the requisition.
The impending trading list also foresaw a formal opening of the Qingdao sewerage right, which would also be the first to trade in the country's sewage rights first and a nationwide trade in sewage rights.
In the morning, Qingdao Double Chemical Co., Ltd. general manager Zhao Xiuping came to the Qingdao Sewage Trading Center to submit a requisition for pollutant rights.
The company is located in the Old Town of Qingdao last year at the end of last year, the environmental protection relocation to the new plant.
After Zhao submitted materials on the application form and the environmental impact statement of construction projects, the reserve for sewage rights reserve and trading service centers of Qingdao started preliminary examination on application materials.
According to the standards for collecting standards determined by the price and finance departments of Qingdao, the original estimate for the use of initial sewage rights is about 641.12 million yuan, and the staff will be completed within 7 working days.
The impending trading list also foresaw a formal opening of the Qingdao sewerage right, and it would be the first to trade in the country's sewage rights first and a nationwide trade in sewage rights.
Zhao Xiuping said that the current enterprise environment has invested up to 4 billion, surface-to-surface, but has a significant impact on enterprise management concepts and social benefits, and has opened space for entrepreneurial innovations.
On the day, Qingdao Quartet Passenger Accessories Co., Ltd. also used to purchase the sewage rights for an annual production of 4200 high-speed rail and mobile car.
The project belongs to machining enterprises, applications for initial discharge of pollutants are 0.514 tons / years of chemical oxygen (COD), 0.552 tons of nitrogen (NOX) / year (NOX).
The use of the air pollutant pollutant discharge rights and the transaction shall be the key industrial enterprises for the whole city power and heat supply.
The existing pollutant discharging units, which have been obtained by January 1, 2016, are temporarily exempt from compensation fees.
"The right to pay for the discharge of pollutants does not equate to the right to unlawfully discharge the pollutants and not to discharge pollutants arbitrarily."
Han Yan, deputy director of the Environmental Protection Bureau of Qingdao, introduced that if illegal pollutants and supercursors were still punishable according to relevant regulations, it would not be possible to allow illegal businesses to avoid penalties by buying pollutants.
In other words, it is necessary to crack down on environmental violations by legal means, severely punish the over-the-counter pollution of enterprises, thereby protecting the environment and ensuring public health.
The enterprise now enhances the motivation of pollution and cherishes limited pollution rights, and reduces the discharge of pollutants in its own interests.
With economic interests, the reduction of pollutant emissions from government coercive behaviour translated into entrepreneurial market behaviour, thus genuinely achieving the protection of the environment, protecting nature and protecting the health of the public.
Sewage rights refer to "emission rights" as the right to discharge pollutants, indicating the right of exporters to discharge pollutants in the environment in accordance with the quota allocated by the Government.
This right is essentially the right of pollutants to occupy, use and gain the resources of the environmental capacity.
Next, on the precondition that the total amount of pollutant discharge does not exceed the permit for emissions, the amount of pollutants exchanged between the various sources of pollutants is exchanged.
The trading of sewerage rights since the US economist Doss was filed in 1968, began the United States in the 1970s to manage the pollution source of the atmosphere and rivers.

Russia will continue to build its military infrastructure at the base, and the living conditions of Russian military personnel will also be guaranteed accordingly.
He also said that those forces would be extended to Russia if they did not fight against extremist forces.
Russia has intensified its cooperation with Syria, Iran and Iraq in this regard, although Russia has not reached an agreement with the West to fight against the Islamist extremist forces.
In September 2015, Russia, at the invitation of the Syrian Government, began a military strike against the forces of Syria.

Xiamen girl Zhang Bingbin: "The hand-style" began to shoot the road with a few "reverse"
A few days ago, Zhang Dong-dong, the village of Xiamen's eastern district, changed its 29-inch old TV to a 65 inch wide television.
The daughter of the ordinary farmer was Zhang Bingbin, a silver medal for the women's 50 meters of women in the Rio Olympics in the evening of the day.
On the evening of this new television, Zhang Dong and dozens of relatives and friends, together with dozens of relatives, witness her daughter's miraculous process of reversing a great reversal from the prevalence.
In the same day, Zhang Bingbin ranked downstream and seemed to be very far away from the finals.
But parents and relatives did not give up, constantly brushing the words, seeing as other athletes finish the game, Zhang Bingbin ascended, finally locking the final seat, his home suddenly erupted from a beset.
In the final of the finals, Zhang Bingbin, who was at once ranked behind the ranking, scored a silver medal with only 0.2 rings in backward champions.
This year's 27-year-old Zhang Bingbin, in 16 years of shooting, has been almost a bit of a silver-wicked silver-washed silver medal.
His mother, Zhang Xiao, told reporters that when they hesitated, Zhang Bin found a few "little lobbyists" in the same village.
These "small lobbyists" were also recommended in the same village of the same village, as well as Zhang Bingbin cousin.
Shortly after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Bingbin took the initiative to return to the school's school for reasons such as family difficulties.
But after his enlightened coach Zhang Yajie repeated his work, Zhang Bingbin returned to Xiamen.
After entering the provincial squadron, Zhang Bin was too late to get back to his home because he couldn't see hope.
This time, not only Zhang Jian coach, Xiamen shooting archery center and the leadership and coach of Fujian province, finally persuade Zhang Bin to return to the provincial team.
Like yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl's insistence on the path of shooting has been reversing.
"Every coach chooses to pick the players differently, when I see Bingbin's handsome handicraft, just a moment."
Mr Zhang also remembered that in a training test, her daughter was not the best, but the number of rings was stable, and it was an important reason to attract coach Zhang Bingbin.
In the course of training Zhang Yangbin, Zhang Yaoji was impressed with the inputs of the farmer's child.
He remembered that Zhang Bin entered the Xiamen shooting team a year later, with a prolonged gun training in the team, demanding that the team should not move for half an hour.
Chang Xiaodragon told reporters that her daughter had been a quiet child, who loved painting and self-made toys from childhood.
"I'm going to make clothes at home and sew it up, and Bin will pick up some ingredients on his own," he said.
She said that her daughter often sewed her hand-toy toy, coupled with her good painting, from the doll's five officers to the garment, always can be lifelike.
As athlete, Zhang Bingbin and family members are rare, only holidays will be able to go home, often with telephone connections.
Parents say, no matter whether they meet or call, Zhang Bin seldom speaks of his hard work, much more cheerful with his parents.
There is no daughter in ordinary times. Parents take their daughters at home as well as the honor of the calendar calendar calendar years.
Zhang dragon portrayed her daughter's animated paintings to reporters, "if not as a shooter, she should continue to paint."
On the second floor of Zhang Bingbin, there was a cabinet filled with the medals, medals and certificates she had received.
Zhang Dong-red put the medal and medal neatly, the certificate is put in the folder to preserve, "these are more than ten years of Bingbin's bloody honor, we all cherish."
Recently, Hebei Provincial Filial Piety Fund sent $16,000 consolation to six families in the village of Xiao Shui Xiaozhu.

China's Mars Plan for Mars
China's Mars Exploration mission has a time to encircle, landing, patrol, and this form has never been abroad.
The goal of our Mars exploration launch goal is to take a step around, landing, patrol, and this task is quite difficult.
Because Mars takes 26 months to meet a window window, experts are working closely on engineering plans to launch the country's first Mars detector by 2020.
Notwithstanding the fact that our aircraft has already entered the outer space, the mission of the Mars is indispensable, and the exploration of Mars means that China is in the depths of deep space, he said.
"Once every two or three years, only one of Mars's recent opportunity to launch a Mars detector at this point is the most energetic for the launch rocket."
"Considering the quality of the Mars detector, the launch mission will be completed by our Long March V launch vehicle."
The Mars Exploration mission of our country is going to encircle, landing, patrol, this form has never been in foreign country, the foreign country is going to be surrounded and landed, but landing failed.
Mars exploration involves much of the technical field, especially though it is a spatial detector, but it has a distinct feature compared to the general spatial probe.
In other words, the Mars detector should have the ability to identify driving routes and discover obstacles.
Pang Hai, a 500-caster researcher at China's Space Science and Technology Group, said mankind was so popular about Mars because the detection of Mars was important science, technology, and even the future of mankind.
Nowadays Mars has become a planet with the highest degree of human research in the outside world, using space detectors to carry out Mars exploration almost throughout the human space history.
So human beings hope to set up living bases in Mars one day and eventually emigrate to Mars and turn it into a second homeland.
A large number of signs also suggest that Mars is likely to be like the Earth, just over a billion-year evolution, as the atmosphere is thinner, low temperatures, and water drying up.
Therefore, exploring or manned land Mars can be studied in order to prevent the Earth from becoming a second Mars that is difficult to survive.
By June 2016, a total of 114 lunar exploration and 43 fire detections were carried out worldwide.
However, since the 1990s, humans have conducted 18 Mars exploration in the 1990s, while the lunar exploration has only been 14 times.
There are five Mars orbiters and 2 Mars roaming cars, but only one lunar orbiter and a lunar lander are working.
The world aerospace nation has developed plans for the goal of the Mars system, which shows that today's Mars exploration is hotter than the moon's exploration.
On November 5, 2013, India launched the first Mars probe "Managarian" to become the first country to successfully explore Mars in Asia.
"Managarian" used to study the surface, atmosphere and minerals of Mars, exploring whether there was methane and life signs on Mars.
The most difficult part of this task is the fact that the probe enters the aerodynamic shape and parachute after the Mars' atmosphere.
The Mars Exploration task is faced with many technical challenges, according to Sun Zenzhou, master of the Mars Explorer of China Space Science and Technology Group.
Mars atmospheric pressure is low, and only 1% of the atmospheric pressure on Earth's surface has high uncertainty.
Scientists have not yet been thoroughly aware of the changes in its changes and the nature of the storm.
Mars often forms dust storms similar to the earth's dust in summer, which leads to a drastic drop in the sun's sunlight, which has to be designed for a fire-stamped model to wait patiently for a dust storm.
At the same time, Martian atmospheres also cut off the sun's light, creating problems for the energy supply of Mars.
This requires the probe's sun-wing area to be larger, and needs to be adjusted to work in the direction of the sun.
Moreover, the surface gravity of Mars is only 38% of Earth, but much more gravity than the surface of the moon, so the probe needs greater power.
"The most central and toughest place for the Mars Exploration is that the probe enters the process of aerodynamics and parachute deceleration in Mars, only once a chance to ensure success."
As the Earth is far away from Mars, the entire process cannot be controlled by the ground, so it must be relied on by the detector.
Due to lack of so many propellants to offset the high speed, landing on Mars is to depend on the atmosphere of Mars, but the Mars atmosphere is difficult to simulate.
In general, the way to detect Mars is similar to that of the moon, and it is "round, landing, patrolling," and eventually attaining the goal of manned mars, Mr. Pang said.
Because Mars is far far far from Earth than the moon is far from the moon, the detection of Mars requires a series of more complex technical difficulties.
According to Taiwanese media, the "executive dean" said yesterday morning that "political parties and their accessories of improper access to property" have come into effect from today.
The Vice President of the Kuomintang said that "a hundred years of history of the Kuomintang, with the commitment and responsibility of society, will not fail."
Lin emphasizes that the commission shall investigate and impose sanctions on "according to law" if the political parties, affiliated with organizations or trustees violate the regulations prohibiting the disposition of the Ordinance.
It will also be announced that the deputy chairman of the MPG committee will be held by Bacon Bacon, Deputy Director of the Independent Administration Department.
He said that Mr Gu, who acted as an inappropriate party committee committee, was the basis for the Commission's inventory of the major cases in which he used to inspect the relevant major cases.
He believes that today, if there is still party production, no one will donate to you, and the Kuomintang can petition social support and sponsorship only if the party has been able to ask for social support and sponsorship. "There is really no chance to do it today."
He also underlined that the Kuomintang party had not been fully confiscated and confiscated after the uneven party's rules were delivered, and the remainder would be pledged to make the party to zero, and the Party had everything to start from zero.
The original title: The "corridor physician" Ranger peaks, TCCTV hostess Wang Zi Xian Fame infringement
Evening Evening Speaker Wang Zhenn, a CCTV hostess, published comments on the "corridor physician" event, with Wang Chi and Beijing's Microdream Network Technology Ltd. seeking to court the court.

In the beginning of 2014, the CCTV survey found that, although more than 600 days of Langer peaks in the hospital corridor were portrayed by the media as a sad hero in the system, these reports had a lot of untrue information.
On March 29, 2014, CCTV was broadcast by the CCTV News Survey.
Landy's peak to the media reports of the so-called excessive medical information, there is no evidence of support.
Wang Zhuang, also in the real authentication microblog, describes the "Langer Peak" to this step is character, it carries with it obvious paranoid personality.
Lander's peak calls for Wang Chi to delete microblogging, apologize and compensate for the mental damage of 100,000 yuan.
At the time of the trial, the two sides, whether Wang Chi has infringed on the reputation of the name of the reputation of the reputation.
On the point of view: The Athletics Travel Chinese team is busy with a four-eg.
The bike is expected to achieve "zero breakthroughs" in the Olympic gold medal, and girls will challenge two world championships to the world championship.
Wang Township has been prominent in the last two seasons, last year the silver medal in Beijing's track and field harvesting, and the group's bid to upgrade the personal program.
The 27-year-old South Korean archery Zhang Huichen won gold medals in the women's archery race and won the Olympic gold medal after winning the Olympic gold medal.
Zhang Jian was thought to be a late player, who regretted not having won the last London Olympics, but was now proud to stand on the top podium of the Rio Olympic Games.
Zhang Jane won the gold medal in Lisa Andrew, Germany, with a total 6-2 defeat in the women's archery at the Rio Samba Avenue at Rio's Rio Boulevard.
She was the first to shoot in the fourth grade of elementary school until the 27-year-old won the first gold medal in the World Cup for the first time in 2014, a late contestant.
Zhang Jan recalls, "There was no level before high school that could not take part in the national competition."
Zhang Jane, who was only fourth in the London Olympic Games four years ago, has lost the Olympic ticket, and can only take two gold medals from colleague and friend Chewu Chibu.
Zhang Jane talked about her sweetheart at the end of the women's archery ceremonial ceremonial ceremony, "until finally all the way to shoot the arrows as soon as possible, it may be a good result."
The 28-year-old South Korean archery, a gold medalist for the London Olympic archeerarchy, won bronze medal medals.
Chifu lost to Zhang Jane in the semi-finals, with Mexican swimmer Alex Handra Valencia competing for bronze.
Sophie, who ensured the sprinkler of the bronze, was able to conceive of the bursting burden.
First of all, the coach team accumulated rich experience in constant research, followed by scientific training, all of which need to be accumulated long.
The archery team, in military training, night crossing the cemetery, helps the players focus on and maintain ordinary heart.
Although it has not yet been confirmed, many sources say the company will be held in September, and the iPhone 7 will be in place in September.
While Apple does not respond, the function and configuration of the new iPhone has been released, and even the iPhone 7 "real machine model" has been photographed.
The new iPhone is "eye-catching", hot, tight, free of money... if you want to buy a product for the first time, you must choose a good avenue, say, Su Yingnan.
This has exacerbated the disappointment of new phones, "it added, but it was simply not able to project holographic images! The iPhone's iPhone was bad."
The iPhone 7, like the other iPhone, was accompanied by numerous secrets before birth.
Moreover, multiple sources claim that a new generation of iPhones will cancel 3.5 mm headphone interfaces and use Bluetooth connections and recharging interfaces, which will add space to Apple's second speaker.
Another evidence of the news is that, as early as 2014, Apple allows headphone manufacturers to produce headphone products via charging interfaces.
These news or true or false, the answer until the autumn of Apple's 2016 session can be unveiled.
But that does not hamper the outlook for the iPhone 7 鈥? many believe the iPhone 7 will probably be a last step in Apple's upgrades on the iPhone series.
Despite data published by the latest market research firm IDC, the market share of the iPhone has fallen.
Goldman Sachs maintains Apple's shares' buying 'rating, while analysts in BMO believe the iPhone 7 will harvest a historic sales performance.
The company's chief executive, Hock Tan, also says Apple will likely increase its future revenues by more than 20 per cent, which is entirely benefiting from the iPhone 7 launch.
About 7 per cent of respondents said they had a plan to buy iPhone 7, compared with only 4 per cent planned to buy the iPhone six years ago.
It is a fairly high percentage to have 20 per cent of the group's user groups with iPhone 6 or 6Plus plans to buy the iPhone 7.
Second, experts analyze, most of the fruit powders enjoy the replacement of their iPhone phones.
According to statistics, about 26 per cent of users in all iPhone users have been unable to replace mobile phones for two years, or about 120 million users in the iPhone have been used for two years.
"There is a number of earthquakes in Taiwan during the iPhone 7 production," the media said. "The damage to Taipei production facilities exceeds imagination and is likely to have an impact on the initial iPhone 7 supply."
Contrary to supply and demand can affect ordinary users, the time to choose a good channel, the first time at the price of the iPhone 7.
According to a person familiar with the matter, the company is meeting with Apple in the near term, with the aim of preparing adequate supplies of goods.
The operator has already agreed with Su in and foresees that with the depth of cooperation between the two sides, it will inevitably bring lower prices and more intimate services for users.
"Minimum prices, consumers may" need only seven yuan a day to buy the iPhone 7. "
Abundant goods and diverse treatments make the iPhone 7 no longer "Stress Mountain", and the logistics of Su Ning will become a more intuitive sense of experience.
Maybe you'll get a phone call in the middle of the night, "Hello, Su Ning, your iPhone 7 to your iPhone."

According to foreign media reports, because the pool of water from the blue green, the Rio Olympic "green pool" events have been outside attention recently.
In the morning, however, water in the pool of water polo matches adjacent to a diving pool turned green.
Australian water polo players said his eyes were hurtful and tried to shed tears.
Previously, the official officials of the Rio Olympics confirmed the green water, suggesting that water variations were due to the weakening of alkaline, which would not affect athletes' physical health.
But Australian athletes, after winning a victory with Japanese teams in the water polo pool, said their eyes were stinging.
Early in the morning, the organizers deal with the diving pool at night, but the colors of water polo pools have changed quickly in the morning, as early as the pools of water are green in the pool.
The environmental conditions in the water polo pool have deteriorated gradually during the Australian and Japanese games, but officials stress they will return the water quality of the two swimming pool to their original colours on 11 December.
Mario Andra, a spokesman for the Rio Olympics, said: "Yesterday afternoon, the degree of alkaline is weakened by the degree of alkaline."
"We understand a series of factors that might trigger the colors of a pool and the quality of the water," he said.
The water sports center conducted a series of tests on water quality, and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the swimming pool to determine the quality of water.
"We've been doing a normal program these days, but we might have ignored the more likely the athletes could influence water quality."
"But the change in water colour is sure to be healthy, especially for athletes," he said.
"This independent team confirms our assessment and confirms the measures we take to restore the normal color of the pool and the normal chemical state."
"We have hoped to restore the normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery has been affected by the rain."

On August 12, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the state of the economy in July 2016.
The Director of the National Bureau of Statistics, the Chief Statistics Spokesperson of the National Bureau of Statistics and the Director of the National Economic Statistics Division, said that in July the national economy was slowing down in July, but it was still running at a reasonable range.
According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, data on fixed asset investment growth in July and total imports have fallen.
Referring to the state of the economy in July, I want to borrow a word that the prime minister has said "shape, the situation is still good," which can better summarize the traits of the economy in July.
He explained that the "fluctuation" was the fact that in July some economic indexes were slowing.
Since the economy is still in deep adjustment in July and in July, the international situation is complex and the world economy is less than expected, so export pressure is still relatively big.
From domestic standpoint, the entire economy is still in the key phase of adjustment, the adjustment of the pain is released, the economy is faced with low downward pressure, some of the indicators fluctuate.
In July, there was a special situation in which the floods were more severe and the weather had some impact on production operations in some parts of the region.
More than 60 million people have hit the country, losing more than $200 billion in direct economic losses, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Different degrees are affected by the pertinent indicators of industrial, investment and transport transport.
The increase in cargo turnover in July fell 3.6 percentage points from last month, and floods had a certain impact on traffic in these areas.
From these factors, the fluctuations in parts of July are also normal, and are expected to be expected.
"The gesture is still good," he said, notwithstanding the slowdown in economic growth, but the economy has been generally stable, and the momentum in stable and stable stability has not changed.
In July CPI rose 1.8%, climbing 0.2%; in July the CPI rose 2.1 per cent in July, so the price situation was overall stable.
According to the Vehicle Network of Chongqing Municipal Meteorological Bureau, the rest of the city can receive high temperature allowance in the rest of the city, except for the Yang Yang.
At least 28 provinces nationwide have identified subsidies for allowances, but the standards are not the same as those issued by the provinces, while Chongqing will pay high temperature allowance in the form of a high temperature workday allowance.
35 Celsius below 37 Celsius is issued at no less than 10 yuan per person per day; 37 ℃ at the rate of no less than 15 yuan per person per day.
The high temperature staff of 40 degrees Celsius at the maximum rate of 20 yuan / day allowances (except those who have enjoyed high calorific work allowances in accordance with law).
In line with this criterion, last month, the largest number of days of high temperatures can be reached in 330 yuan, the least of which is 80 yuan, while the most high temperatures in the city do not have high temperatures, so there are no high temperatures.
A large number of units used to rush to the high temperature allowance of cool drinks, and the Municipal Police Bureau indicated that such practices did not conform to the current method.
If the time for working and shortening the working hours of high temperature and weather, the employing unit shall not deduct or reduce the wages of labourers.
The Municipal Public Welfare Bureau said the staff had been subject to high temperatures at high temperatures to obtain the lawful rights and interests of the labor dispute mediation agencies in the enterprise, or to dial up 12333 complaints.
Where an employing unit refuses to grant high temperature allowances, labourers may file a complaint with the competent department of human resources undertakings at or above the county level in the place where the employed worker is located.
At the same time, if the high temperature allowance is part of wages, it is not welfare, shall be incorporated in the total salary and deductions.
Therefore, the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage, which must be distributed in the form of cash and cannot be substituted in kind.

In other words, all the motor vehicles and 30 out of the train can stop in Urumqi.
Now two stations can buy tickets, and the train passes around about 10 minutes. Passengers need to pay attention to the specific stations of the ticket starting and terminal points.
The official operation of the Urumqi new passenger station will be an important platform for Xinjiang to build a national comprehensive traffic city, and push forward the construction of the Silk Road and New Area.
Greycia is a deviant female mouthpiece, the breath of tropical rainforest with all her body.
In Central American Costa Rica, the giant knee Grecia and its stories have already been known.
At a news conference on Aug. 10, the postoperative Gregor finally appeared to show people the new 3D printout of the plasma beak.
It's a year and a half ago that people break the beak, dying of the mighty mouthpiece, and now regenerate.
Not only did it declare its 100% return to health, but it was a day when it moved into a luxury bird house, and a day to care about its human friends.
Gregcia, a new home, was slightly shy, but not much time became lively, rolling it in the basin and grapping with new beaked beaks.
To remind people that they had been hurt, the technician did not give it a new beak, but retained the 3D print material original white.
Bird beaks are a thin layer of kernel sheath, inside the middle, only some fine bone supporting rod crossing the alignment.
Although there is such an internal reinforcement, the beak of the mouthpiece is fragile and is broken when hurt.
Animal bailouts, birds and a US 3D print company worked together to make several "experimental beaks" for Greycia, at last making the best suits for its "perfect beaker."
Now Gregor has been able to use a new beak to drink water, eat something, even peck a small grain.
"It takes about two months to design the final finished product, and print out only four or five hours."
"3D Printing is not a future technology, it is actually going into your life," Thomas Lenger, chairman of SG3D printing company, said in an interview with New China's international reporters.
In January 2015, a farms of Greycia, Gregor, in central Costa Rica, were found to have been found in Greycia.
At the time its beak was brutally broken by a group of young people, and it was absolutely impossible to eat.
Gregor's massacre, after media reports, caused a wave of opponents of animal abuse in Costa Rica.
There is a demand for more stringent animal protection laws and more punishments for ill-treatment.
People came spontaneously, trying to help Gregor as much as possible to recover his injured life.
Even 3D printing technology inventors Chuck Hull is also involved in the design of Greycia's beaked beak.
"Gregor's situation is exceptional, with the rest of its beak less than 1 cm, so there are many difficulties to install new beaks."
"We're scanning Grega and then designing and making a lengthy prosthesis that is longer than the rest of its beak, with sticky sticks on its beak."
"This could reduce the inflexible damage to Greycia," Mr Langer told New China reporters.
Before the installation of the fake body, the staff will have to clean the beak for Gregor to prevent infection.
Outside thousands of miles, the story of Gregor Greycia was touched by the famous documentary director Paula Eredia and John Hoffmann, who explored News Channel.
They recorded the drips of Gregor's new beak, recording a documentary "State of the Great Housebird," broadcast this month on the Animal Planet Channel.
The documentary, "The Country of the Great Housebird," shows how a small mouthpiece has allowed a country to change, how to let citizens participate in anti-abusive animals.
Core Tip: Japanese oil companies are particularly alert to the rise of small independent refineries known as "teapot".
JX Energy, Japan's largest oil producer, said 'China's expansion is one of the reasons for the downturn,' said the news network Aug. 12, reporting by the Chinese media.
Japanese oil companies are in particular alert to the rise of small independent refineries known as "teapot".
The quality of petroleum products in China is gradually approaching Japan's oil products by strengthening environmental protection regulations.
Before receiving a crude oil import license, "teapot refinery" typically refines the heavy oil that has high sulphur content in Russia such as Russia.
The production of sulphur sulphur in the production of petroleum products is one of the reasons for environmental pollution.
After receiving a crude oil import license, "teapot refinery" can import Oman crude oil and Russian crude oil with low sulphur content, and the quality of its petroleum products has also risen.
"With the improvement of quality standards in China's domestic oil products, the ability to refine oil equipment has also increased," said the company's GM.
As a result, the quality of oil products exported from China gradually reached the same level as Japan (the highest quality of the world).
"After the end of 2015, China began to compete with Japanese products in the Asian market," said JX Energy.
While "Japan's high-taste oil" is facing a crisis, the response strategies taken by Japanese oil companies are only "exported to areas with profitable graphs," while Japanese oil companies are only "focusing on market conditions."
As China's exports of oil products have a huge impact on Asian markets, the attention is also being paid to teapot refineries.

The ultraviolet is not only the skin of the classmates, can burn the skin, how to get the skin smoothly through military training, not sunburn?
Sunscreen packaging is usually marked with SPF and PA, SPF is a sunscreen index that is directed against UVB ultraviolet rays, with 15, 30, 50 and so on the SPF index.
PA products are targeting UVA, which can play a more effective role, usually with the strength of PA's strength to indicate that more effective protection time is prolonged.
Oil skin should choose a strong waterproof sunscreen supplies, the sunscreen spray is also a good choice.
The dry skin should choose frostbite supplies; the neutral skin has no strict stipulation that the sensitivity skin is a burden on any maintenance of the skin, proposing the selection of pure physical sundsun products.
Remember the sunscreen half an hour earlier, because the sunscreen will take time to completely penetrate into the skin.
The military training day is longer, the sunscreen can be used every two hours to have lasting effect, do not sabotage.
Since the skin has just been stimulated by sunburn, military training does not immediately use American white products.
After the military training, if conditions can be used with a towel wrapped in the ice, the scorching skin can be used to slow down local heat.
Peasant households who buy agricultural aircraft during the exhibition will continue to adopt a supplementary subsidy policy, and the purchase of agricultural aircraft by farmers is of a maximum 40 percent.
The exhibition will be geared towards global recruitment, especially for the "one way" along the lines of countries and target markets for the target market.

The "Hunan blog" is known for seven consecutive years to go back to Loohueo, Hunan province, and industrial development.
As the hosting of "Xiang Po," Mr Lohu has established trade relations with more than 90 countries around the world.
The "Hunan blog" has become the development and promotion of specialty industries to follow the key platform of the national door.
On some nights, the ionosphere is full of free electrons, which means that radio signals can go far further.
The U. S. Air Force is interested in copying this effect, according to the U. S. Journal of Volunteers on August 11.
Although a stable, free electronic ionosphere can help people listen to the radio station at some university radio station, it may not be an interest in the U. S. Air Force.
Electronic ionosphere means that the military has a wider range of radio broadcasts, and it may provide some protection for the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal to protect it from the solar storm.
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of cubic satellites in demand, which can strengthen the ionosphere when needed.
But first, a team of contracts with the Air Force must prove that the scientific principles will work.
Industry figures show that the production capacity is close to 6 billion tonnes by 2015, with an excess of 1.8 billion tons of coal.
Over the past decade, a total of five notifications of excess and backward capacity have been published by the State Council.
Although the first four were not targeted at the coal industry, the target industry was directly associated with the coal industry.
Last November, in January, the 500-500 coal-powered coal price of the Qinhuanian island was hovering in 370 yuan / tonnes and 90 per cent of its coal companies fell into losses.
Since February, coal prices have recovered, and recently the QinQin powered coal price is more than four consecutive weeks, rising to a 16-month high, up to 436 yuan a tonne, up nearly 70 yuan from the start of the year.
As prices recover, people worry that it follows: a batch of small coal mines will not resume reproduction?
In this regard, China (Hainan) has analyzed and interpreted the Director of the Economy of the Development Research Institute of China.
Quang Qian: The capacity for capacity has aroused the high concern of all parties, and today's report card on the coal industry has indeed made everyone feel more worried.
The factors of these three layers also reflect a relatively lagging reason for the change in our way of growth in the past, which has yet to be fundamentally shifted by the government-led growth pattern.
Second, it is directly related to the promotion of the local government, and in the process of going to capacity, the funds and corresponding supporting measures are in place, and in this regard the differences in different regions do not seem to be much greater.
Third, if some of the more slowly progressive provinces are going to catch progress in the second half of the year, they may face greater risks.
In this case, the process of relying on the central awards to promote the process of capacity may have a negative impact.
First, it is not simple to carry out the total volume control.
Our aim is to eliminate backward production capacity, promote structural optimization and reconstruct new industrial states in the coal industry.
In the process of deploying capacity, local governments will have to combine the upgrading of capacity and the coal industry to develop the related services.
Second, to complete this year's mission mission to the end of this year, we still need to give full play to the power of administrative supervision and administrative supervision.
Finally, we should strengthen the intrinsic role of social security.
Because the market is directly involved in employment problems, we need to strengthen employment skills training for staff and workers.
"The reason for the decline is that foreign ownership is expected to deteriorate in the medium term."

Originally: The Canadian Police Skill Supporters: Self-made bomb attacks on the city's preparation
The taxi company said the taxi had been dispatched to Debray's home before police arrived.
Police in Canada said in a news conference Wednesday that information received by the police included the "martyrdom videos" provided by the FBI about the young man's assault on the attack.
According to German acoustic reports, a man wearing a black Barakara cap is reading the Koran, referring to the Muslims, and swore soon to attack a Canadian city.
In the video, he said, the attack would take place within 72 hours and was at peak time.
The incident was the first time when the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Traverau took office last year, killing suspected suspects for the first time in the incident.
After upgrading the upgrade of the Beijing-Hanging Canal canal, the Old Fukuda River and North Dollar Channel took charge on September 1.
These two tributaries take the form of social financing in the form of social financing, which has been approved by the provincial government departments.
The Old Wancou River channel flowed through the Golden Township and Fisherland, with a total length of 32.5 km from Lake Nanyang.
According to navigational requirements, the modalities for conservation of the Old Wanblin River were carried out in the form of conservation renovation, deep in the depth of local waters, and a partial curtailment of the traffic conditions had been improved.
The channel flowed through Kim Xiong County, as a city district, through Nanyang Lake into the main canal on the Grand Canal in Beijing.
The reformation of two channels in February 2011 was completed in February 2015 and completed in January 2015, and investment construction and operational entities were a centre for logistics service in the Anping Canal in Benin.
In accordance with the principle of "loan construction, charging loans," the Logistics Service Centre of the Anping Canal in Tianjin has levied navigation channels on the basis of charging standards in the Shandong Province.
Among these, basic toll costs are calculated at 1.75 yuan / weight tonnes, and the cost of mileage will be collected by a heavy tonnage of 0.05 / km.
The amount of toll collection is expiring from 15 June 2016 to 14 June 2019.
The reporter learned from the Hong Kong Airways Board of Benjinin that there were four charging channels in Jinning, respectively, for the Hu River waterway, the Bai Ma river channel, the north-west landing channel and the Old Wanblin River.
Article 4 navigational channels as a tributary channel for the Beijing-Hanging Canal, the way for social financing is to be promoted.
The renovation project of the Hushu waterway upgrading is the first to use the "Government + Market" model for project construction projects in Shandong Province, where the government accounts for investment in the main subjects and the shortfall in social funds.
The Bai Ma River, the Old Fukuda River, the North Daily, and so on are the way of pure marketability.
The financial allocations of the State cannot satisfy the needs of construction projects and restrict the progress of the airway upgrade.
Social funds for the construction of public infrastructure conform to the requirements of national policies and become the way to crack down on the bottlenecks.
Ning Zedong's performance in the 100-meter freestyle semifinal has made many Chinese audiences unspoken.
But in the 50-meter freestyle pretrial, Ningzeso once again refreshed the "bottom line".
In fact, the 50-meter freestyle is not NYSO, his performance and best performance at the Kashan World Championship, also decided that he could make a breakthrough in the project.
Indeed, Hong Kong's authoritative media, the Daily Gazette, revealed that the biggest reason for Ningzi's failure was that he had lost interest in swimming.
Many of the factors outside the field might have had a big impact on the idea of the future, and he is likely to be more interested in entering the entertainment circle.
After the Kashan World Championship, NingzesTao, with its overhigh face and good grades, became the net red.
So the title of "national husband", "small flesh", "beautiful boy", etc., also continues to be the label on him.
All kinds of business activities find the door, good money, become a golden glittering boulevard.
In this case, Ningzo, even if it chooses to retire in the entertainment circle, is not only his freedom, but a feasible path.
After all, he was only 23 years old, and through a certain study, it was entirely possible to perform one or two TV dramas on his own.
But Ning Zedong needs to see that it is not enough to qualify for the predecessors compared to these predecessors?
The 2000 Olympics in Sydney, already 21 years old, have come to the end of the athlete's career.
Liu Xuan's beautiful appearance allows her to be remembered quickly, also lays the foundation for her future march into entertainment.
After retiring, Liu Jiaxuan made a number of TV dramas and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tian Liang took part in two of the first two games of the Games, and got 2 in two gold medals.
But after he lost to his teammates in a 10-meter race in the 2004 Games, Tian's competitive state slipped and was exploited by the diving team.
And when he and his daughter took part in the Circular Circle of Daddy, he made him make eyeball.
Once in the gymnastics Gold generation, Yang Wei, Li Xiao Peng, and Chen's ice are all high-profile.
It is worth mentioning that Yang Xiaopeng led China to win the 2008 Olympic championship championship, Yang Wei more than twice the personal gold medal, known as the kings.
And Chen is also the king of the hilly rings while leading China to the 2012 Olympic championship champion.
After having missed the gold medal at the London Olympics, there was an icy move, and he made him innumerable.
But the athlete's main focus is still on the playground, and it's just like a dragon, just like a dragon.
But no matter whether retired or active athlete, access to entertainment will need to be guaranteed to do the job.
After all, the athlete stepped into a new area, both the ability and the human vein, a state of blank.
Even Tian Liu, Liu Jiaxi, for many years "old", ordinary audience lodged them, more or more thought of their performance at the Olympics.
New people, such as Yang Wei, Li Xiaoping, are introduced at the time of the show, no exception is "Olympic champion."
The name of a swimmer swimming championship in Yanzeo is still slightly thin compared to several of the above.
Moreover, in contrast to the ups and downs of the fields of Tian, Liu Yuan, Yang Weigh, Yanzeo, a little setback at the age of 23 and a sportswear, is probably immeasurable in the negative impact of its image.
After all, an athlete, the demand of the people is "not a winner, but not daunting", NYZJEO is still far away from this point.
Ten thousand steps to say, Yanzeso is handsome, can rely entirely on the Yan Yi to obtain the support of the thousands of brains.
Not a bit of power, only on appearance, want to be blended in the entertainment circle, it is no less difficult to get back to the right state.
The way of life is to choose all the personal will, but how to choose, Ning Tao should have counts.
On the surface, network social networking has expanded the circle of communicative circles, reducing people's loneliness.
The wider range of social networking, not only gradually substitutes for traditional telephone contacts, even penetrates into the down-real life circle, quietly changing the social life of the people.
The benefits of social networking are obvious, such as convenience, so it is especially easy to be favoured by young ethnic groups.
Fifty-seven percent of college students use mobile phones more than 5 hours a day for more than five hours a day, according to a survey of college students' social habits.
"Social networks have the characteristics of low-cost, speedy transmission, multi-person exchanges, and the needs of contemporary college students."
Expanding interpersonal circles, more equal dialogues, avoiding social concerns is the main reason for our deep-rooted chatting on the line.
The newcomers of the company love to communicate with colleagues, "because the company is not too cooked, the relationship with the social platform, the relationship is much more than before."
Love Friends also communicate with the line, "I've been with friends because some misunderstanding has been untouched for some time, and then conversations in a large crowd."
IT Engineer Wu Speech is a deep network social enthusiast, and most of his social life takes place on line, the network contacts are more than doubling the number of the bottom friends.
Mr. Wu also confessed that it was more "water to water" on the internet.
"You can return your friends when you're convenient, because there's a lot of discreet sentences that can be clearer," he said.
"Being hidden under ID, I'm going to avoid face-to-face collision, not only in the room, but even more to think about the time and space of words and deeds."
"Different identities have the right and the efficiency of the same speech, the social concerns in real life, and seem to be eliminated in cyberspace."
But Wu's friend, Xiao Peng, feels that in his life, Wu is a "very funny man."
Little Peng and Wu are acquainted with a large group, because both are active speakers and are soon acquainted with them.
Little Peng thinks that Wu is a man on the Internet, talk boring, or unsolicited opinions, turned out to be a few "ha, good, is it?" it's not "I want to check the Internet."

The surface looked calm before, under the bottom of the drainage!
But she was still desperate to swim to the little girl.
Huang Yiin said the river water turbid, turbulent, less than 5 meters distance, almost flashed her all the strength.
She struggled to push the little girl to the banks of the river. "The slope is particularly slippery, I'm afraid I don't have strength to sink."
As a result, Huang Yilin told her mother to help, hear her daughter's cry, the water poor Yin is prepared to bail out the rescue, be stopped by the tourists.
On Aug. 10, Huang Yiqiang's rescue of people, Ms. Yin, while receiving a lot of affection and praise from many friends, also received a "responsibility" for many friends and relatives.
"Looking back in retrospect!" said the truth, when the child persistently persisted on the bank of the river and came to my rescue, my heart was shattered. "
Ms. YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYO said that although it was dangerous, but if it was once again, she would support her daughter's choice, and she was proud of her daughter!
Due to being forced, Huang Yiin, who learnt to swim after swimming, rarely went to the water, "did not think that this skill is actually used."
Huang Yirenn was recognized as a "bully" in the class, and is ready to help others, "said Chen Xiaoyi, a director at Huyyun class.

The Tigers of the Northeast are now endangered by the World Confederation of Natural Conservation (IUCN) endangered species of endangered species.
In 1998, Jilin was only 4 to 6, the northeastern leopard between 3 and 5, according to the Jilin province.
In recent years, Jilin has increased the protection of wildlife, and the population of the Northeast Tiger and Northeast leopard is growing significantly in China, according to Changchun in Jilin province.

Greenland shark, known as the Sleeping Shark, is widely distributed in the North Atlantic Sea around Greenland and Iceland, up from 4 to 5 metres in adulthood.
But their growth rate is extremely slow, sometimes about 1 centimeter long, suggesting that Greenland shark may have an extraordinarily long life span.
Traditional measurements typically use calcification of animals, and some sharks can use flipper ridges, but the calcification tissue is very rare in Greenland's sharks.
A new study led by Julius Nielsen, of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, has been used to use the gllens of the Greenland shark for radioactivity.
The method had previously been used to determine the age of whales, but it was the first time to determine the fish, such as sharks.
Their analysis shows that the biggest shark life is estimated to be 392 years, and the error is 120 years old.
This is to say that the shark is at least 272 years old, most likely to reach 512 years.
In addition, female Greenland's Greenland shark is allegedly mature when it is about 4 meters long, and the age is the age of at least 156 years old.
The researchers wrote in the paper that Greenland sharks are known, longest vertebrate vertebrates on Earth, outstripping the former longevity championship (211 years old).

In late August, Japan's Prime Minister Abe Abe will attend the Sixth African Development Conference in Kenya, according to Chinese acoustic "summit of news."
The African Development Conference was dominated by Japan, with the previous five meetings being held in Tokyo or Yokohama, where the meeting would also be the first to transcend Africa.
Foreign ministry officials said the meeting in Africa was helping to raise concerns about Japan from African and European countries.
In conjunction with Mr. Abe's visit, the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party will send members to the countries concerned.
Japan's "usual" path began in the early 1990s, and the African Development Conference, launched by Japan, began in 1993, not coincidence!
Does Africa have 53 seats in the United Nations, an important balloon for the United Nations, Japan's desire to "get out" and how to abandon Africa?
It will also exchange views with relevant people on the extremist organization of "Islamic State" and terror activities.
The western group will visit seven countries such as Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau.
Mr Wu, Japan's foreign bank, has recently described its intentions at the U. N. Security Council on the African Development Conference.
It was announced that, for the sub-Saharan sub-Saharan African countries, it would provide 1 billion yen ($6.1 billion) of yen (6.1 billion yuan) in five years.
Observers generally believe that Japan's generosity for Africa has been mainly two goals: one is to increase Japan's sense of presence in Africa; it is to win the support of African countries on a common issue.
"On the political front, Africa is relatively lagged, but the number of countries is much more, so Japan has always seen it as a so-called" big ticket field, "said Yang Birjiang, an expert on Japan.
Japan will not give up in the future, and the work of Africa will not end, and will continue to reinforce it.
Economically, because Japan's productive capacity is relatively strong, domestic markets are relatively limited, especially in the midst of an ageing of young people, and domestic demand is relatively weak.
However, from Koizumi, a 10 years ago, to Abe, 10 years later, Japan had launched a number of routine "sprint", but all the time.
Japan's expert, Yang Birjiang, thinks Japan's intent is clear, but the usual road is going to be hard.
Japan wants to achieve its own goals, first and foremost to do a good job with its neighboring countries, in which Japan needs a right attitude, whether in geopolitics or on ethnic disputes and historical awareness.

Traditional customs introduce new bright spots "2016 Lenelwood Culture Festival"
The music of the drum drums, the traditional small food, the faint decoration, the crowd surging the scene.
The "2016 Lenelwood Culture Festival" was hosted by the Hong Kong Tuba Society Society, which was the biggest one in Hong Kong.
In addition to continuing to "rob one of the races", it adds to the "parental basin" that the family can participate in.
Not only is the comic form of enzyme cultural history, the scene also has enzyme themes 3D self-picking area, traditional small food area and traditional handicraft flow classroom, attract many children and overseas to experience visits.
A couple of couples from France stayed at the scene for nearly three hours, and had experienced in the mini-flower movement classroom.

Liu blessed to study "double repairs and double cities" in Sanya, the city construction tube level
In the morning, Liu Chau held a symposium and listened to the report of the "Twin Cities" of the "Two-city" pilot project and suggestions of the departments concerned.
Liu gives full recognition to the results achieved in the pilot work and the good experience and good practices that have been created.
Mr Liu emphasizes that Mr Sanya will seize the historical development opportunities closely and take the "Twin Cities" pilot work as important grappling work, and play a well-demonstrated role in the economic and social development of the whole province.
To promote the internationalization of international tourist island, take a leading role from the point of detail to enrich international elements and create international boutiques.
We should play a leading role in urban and rural integration and overall domain tourism, speed up the construction of a small town, integrate tourism elements into each project, and build a tourist attraction in every country and town of Sanya.
It is necessary to play a leading role in the 100-day operation of the social investment in social investment, promote a number of major projects and the building of the park, ensure the fall of high-quality projects, and implement the requirements of the major operations.
Zhang Qi, deputy governor of the provincial committee, Zhang Qi, Deputy Governor Wang Road, provincial government secretary-general Zhang Zi participated in the study.
In her fourteen years of athletic life, Deng, who won 18 world champions, became the first to win four Olympic gold medals in the history of China's Olympic Games.
She maintains the world for eight consecutive years in table tinges, ranking the longest female athlete in the history of table tennis.
On 26 September 2010, the deputy secretary-general of the People's Daily newspaper and the general manager of the People's Search Network and the General Manager of the People's Search Network.
She will work together with Yu Minkong to build the country's first sportsmanship start-up platform.
There are such a group of star coaches in the Chinese altar: they win countless glory for the nation's sportsmanship; after retiring many years after retiring, it has been taught to cultivate and cultivate the winning army.
As the first world champion for Chinese men gymnastics, Huang Yu chooses to pick up a whip after retirement.
From a female team coach to a man's coach, to the master coach, Huang Bin built an "Olympic Corp," and more squad at the Beijing Games with 9. 1 trillion myths of mythical theories.
Since then, Tian Liang has continued to advertise, and has played an important role in recent years as a "bull", "Lei Feng".
Many of the NBA players have proven their own strength, but some progress has been declining.
Whether the age of age or time is limited, the performance of a number of players in each season will be retreated.
Certainly, some "retreat" may simply be the shrinkage of data, the strength of which may not fall.
Even Wade is one of the best defenders in the coalition, but his performance in the bull should not be so hot.
He and Mr Long's rear range are limited, and the three-point rate at Butler, the star star, is only 32.8 per cent, giving them a crowded offensive next season.
When it comes to the wind city, the flashman is bound to give the ball more to Butler and Ronaldo, and it's likely to be selective in the regular season.
Mr Okawa was more embarrassing, as a first choice for 76 people last season, and he had to compete with Simmons and NBD for the time of the new season.
The competition may not come quickly, and Simmons needs to adapt to the NBA season, and NBD will be able to recover completely from injury, but Mr Okawa can be a problem in 76 men's long man-made man-made man-made positions.
Last season, 32% of Okharu's scores came from low offensive, higher than Cincus, Wuxevich and Brooke Lopez, and his usage was also the top 40 of the alliance.
As Simmons has shown a superb control of the ball, NBD also has a better shape for the NBA game, and Okawa's status is likely to be hard to stand again.
In the past two seasons, Thompson's usage has stabilized in front of the Union 20, and it's the best for his career in the last two seasons.
But the problem is that, with Durant's arrival, Thompson's usage is bound to fall, and that will affect him.
This effect will not only be an impact on the number of times, and the Tang's hoop offense will certainly decrease in the next season, and in some ways it will reduce its defense against his defensive defense.
The arrival of Durant will certainly make the players of the Warrior's team shrink, but the worst of them is Thompson.
But this does not mean that the Tang Dynasty's horizontal retreat is more like his sacrifice for the team.
Parker was better than the figures reflected in the last season, not only because his basket was efficacy, but the chemistry of Aldaridge had also benefited the Massachusetts team.
Duncan retired, and Ginobili was in the end of fighting for a year, and the combination of GDP was finally at the end of the year as the youngest in the three men, and the French road-car tank did not have much oil.
After getting a third championship ring, Jabal, Jordan and Russell James won more regular MVP than James, and Jordan was the only FMVP than James.
Oh, yes, James just brought to Cleveland the first of the first professional sports championships in the last 52 years.
James, who came to the fourteenth season of his career, needed a better guarantee for the season to prepare for the season.
As a result, James's data is likely to fall further in the regular season, and he will give it more weight to Owen, but he will still be easy to become the first three players in the league.
"There must be an array of talent from domestically learned," he said.
On 12 December local time, the president of the Moscow Federation of Chinese Chinese Chinese Confederation was excited when he saw Xinhua.
Shortly before, she attended the training course in China, sponsored by the Office of the Chinese People's Republic of China and the University of Jinnan, "China's Chinese Cultural Community (calligraphy and painting).

After they returned to Moscow, they must have the knowledge and skills they learned, making their own contributions to the spread of Chinese culture and the promotion of the Chinese culture.
At the same time, the Russian-Chinese Association for Promoting Chinese Culture has also felt the same sense.
She said she had a great deal of help with the training of the Course Teacher, and she felt the weight of the "Chinese culture overseas."
He said he was going back to Russia to spread and carry forward the Chinese traditional culture in the Chinese and the Russians who love Chinese culture.

The British team won silver medals in the seven-party football game and Fiji won gold medals.
The team was defeated by Fiji at the Stadium Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, 43, in the finals on Thursday night's seven gold-made football qualifiers, the British team failed to perform in front of Fiji.
Fiji is also the first Olympic medal in the country for its unimpeccable performance in controlling the ball, robbery, avoidance, coincidence, and power.
Silver was a modest consolation for the defeated British team, which was a third silver medal for the British delegation that day. It was enough to be proud of the British football team: they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa for the first time in the seven games of the Olympic football game.
Earlier in the day, the British team had a 7 / 5 win over South Africa, which could affect their status in the finals.
But in any case, now the Fiji team is enough to defeat a full 15 team team.
Tomorrow, at least one of the Englishmen will wear a gold medal, which may be a comfort for the British team, but it may not be. This Briton is a Fisher boss from Wimbleton, who has served as a team coach in the British team.
It is not easy for the British team to achieve today's results.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's coach, they had not tasted at Ardley's international seven-made football football game.
And now they're just walking away from the championship.
Although they have been hit by a huge blow, they have also made a very striking progress.
Fiji has an advantage over the opening of Fiji, making it impossible for the British team.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like a chain of buses. When Osie Colinno broke into the banner, the World Service-Championship team was ahead of a 5 ratio of 5 to 0.
The match was just four minutes, and Jerry Tiger was scoring on the right-wing.
Twelve more, the British team hardly ever touched the ball.
Mitchell's powerful impetus gave the giant Lyon Naara no third score, but it merely slowed the speed of Fiji's scores.
In seven minutes, Sa\ x {7dcc} Milleru was touched at the right corner. 17 / 0, the British team was worse.
The second half of the game had been left for a minute, and the first half of the game was left.
Then Vartmo Lavvo broke off the British team's defense, straight straight to the line.
In the midfield, the ratio was 29 ratio of 29 to 0.
Fiji seems to be born with seven people making rugby football, and the British team is still a louddle.
That's the case.
The British team made a huge change in the second half and hit Fiji's defensive line for a whole four minutes, but it was good for the first half of the second half, with Joshua Tuesosova scoring again.
Dan Norton created a scoring chances for the team, where he touched up to 36 to 7, but the game had already been in the control of the South Sea island, and their fans sang, wielded banners, singing and dancing on the platform.
The magnificent performance of Fiji has had to be patchy.
Matta William, at the last moment, prevented the Fiji team from having an offensive attack.
The final whistle rings, Fiji embraces together, and the finished British team can only regret retreating.
Earlier in the day, Fiji defeated Japan by 20-5 in the semi-finals, while Britain swindled South Africa in a fierce semi-finals.
The first half of Kel Brown helped the South African team to get ahead, but Dan Norton scored a scooter on the second half of the second half.
Later, England's Anthony Anthony brother, Marcus Watson, used a fascinating interception to ensure the team's victory, finally the British team won silver medals.
Helen Glaffe and Heather Stein are encouraged by the coaches of cancer, winning the gold medals in the race.
It is no exaggeration to say that this is the most touching gold medal.
From the first paddle to now, Helen Glaffin and Heather Steinin have received 220 punitive pull training, which has more remarkable significance in the gold medal won by Estacio da Lagoa.
Although the paddle is only two people, but there is another man - coach Robin Williams - the voice of the second consecutive woman's double-digit Olympic Olympic Games, which is the first to reach the high rowing of the rowing woman in Britain.
They have maintained the 39th unbeaten record and have an absolute advantage.
What we see is that these two talents are elegant before the water, but this is not the whole triumph of this victory.
There are many volunteers behind the gold medals in each of the rowers, whose constant devotion has created different forms of help, which is not much more helpful than a 30-month coach who learns a cancer and does not know whether or not he can live on the day.
As he says, death can come at any time.
I was suffering from bladder cancer, and they made an operation for me.
If you do not do surgery, cancerous cells can broaden the body.
In this way it would be much worse.
That's a slight change in your view.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he began treatment at the beginning of 2014, reducing the impact to the lowest, although it might not be appropriate in such cases.
I needed to get paid, so I had to hurry up and down.
It was an inspiration for me.
I lived in the hospital, though they said they were enough to take a few steps, but I'd walk around 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet each time.
This is the starting point of everything.
The rowing movement itself is a journey, and this has made this journey a bit longer.
At the moment of gold, they thought about Williams. This morning Williams was a little more talkative than usual, and that was to overcome his anxiety.
"My mood in this week is very bad, maybe some extreme, but the gold is really a great one," she said after Steinin, who was captain of the Royal Cartillery Corps.
It has repeatedly told me that this is important for me, I, Helen and Robin have made much effort.
It was Helen, Robin and I tried to return for three years.
If there is no Robin, we're just a little jailer, thank him very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I can't find a better trainer and coach than he is.
Helen Glaffe and Heather Stevening had not lost their performance in five years.
This combination of punitive punishments is not comparable to that of their opponents.
Even at the last 500 meter, the New Zealand Team and the Danes began to get closer, and Snannin and Graff still had a lot of physical reserves.
"" No, I don't.
Helen called: "Keep pace, keep pace," he said.
It is really important not to influence the opponents.
We have a very good start, and we are not looking forward to what we have to do with a great deal of a great deal.
We do not want to think of today's glory, we just want to pour each oar and win the game, and we do it.
It took a year to decide on its own future.
Grave would marry Steve Buchar, a television adventurer next month.
Now, however, she just wanted to enjoy it.
I don't want to say that this is my last game.
"It will bring me too much pressure," he said.
In London, I spent about six months realising that I was a champion of the Olympic Games.
It's a new experience, and I feel very nervous.
Approximately 4 minutes have passed.
"I feel much better," she said.

Bulgaria's Inflation for the first time in eight months
The state statistics show that July's inflation rate was 1 per cent in Bulgaria.
That was the highest inflation rate in several years (starting in June 2012), and inflation first broke out of zero last October (0.2% of inflation).
In the past 12 months (August 2014 to July 2014), average annual inflation in the past 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) was -0.8% for the past 12 months (from August 2015 to July 2016).
Consumer prices in July 2016 were 101.0%, or 1.0% in June 2016, compared with the June 2016 consumer price index.
Inflation this year (July 2016) was -0.2% in July 2016, compared with an annual inflation rate of -0.2 per cent in July 2016 compared to July 2016.

Snapchat's "animation" effect is used to satire Asians.
Snapchat says the inspiration of the filter comes from animation, but some observers think it is ethnically ethnic.
Snapchat's 150m daily users can change reality through their filter tools and make the person seem to be ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a role in a pineapple, a dog or one of Roy Litenstein's paintings.
These lens have the effect of blunt and bending characteristics, and more than 30 million of them have been modified every day.
Any error will be immediately followed by the public.
Snapchat lens has been criticized, and the application is used to act as a black or white skin with white skin.
So when the application provides a filter for some users to create an inclined, strange tooth and powdery face this week, some critics call it an ethnic sarcasm for Asia's "yellow people."
They even think that these recurring problems mean that the company has a bigger problem on diversity.
When Snapchat said it had deleted the function, the Verge and Motherboard reported the Verge and Motherboard reports.
The company's explanation is that the filter is a tribute to a cartoon role rather than a satirical Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of the impressive stereotypes that are in reality.
Others resolutely oppose these animated images.
A Hispanic American art, which has been widely shared with these photos, said in an e-mail that the filter "is at least uncomfortable and uncomfortable."
She also said: "It's hard to distinguish between extreme disgusting Asian satire and filter."
Although the filter is not just a yellow species, the yellow people are extremely detrimental.
Snapchat is not the only company that touches the bottom line of these cultures.
The American culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusiveness from the board board to Hollywood and the equipment we carry.
Snapchat's large young group is likely to be very sensitive because of greater emphasis on ethnic diversity than older generation.
When a filter of Snapchat created an insult to users, the 25-year-old said in an interview Thursday, "It's more difficult to escape from people's eyes than before."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, who served as a product manager and engineer in Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do so.
In an article written for Medium and a telephone interview, she said the racial controversy reflected the lack of racial diversity in Snapchat in the recruitment process.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's majority for whites, the leadership all for men and a label at the end of the article: # Delette Snapchat.
As a Chinese-American American, Ms Zhu said: "There are no colors of people in their employees, so they can make such decisions or have some coloured people in their employees, but their positions can't be stunned."
Other observers shared her complaint that she had not been responded by Snapchat.
The company did not publish data about the diversity of employees and said they were a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the race background of its employees, but a spokeswoman said the company recently hired a recruiter specifically to focus on a lower internal ratio and work on internal inclusiveness.
Ms. Zhu said she would close her Snapchat account: "I want to know if they need more people like us to oppose this behavior."
Congressional team said military officials distorted ISIS intelligence intelligence.
A congressional panel said in a report released Thursday that officials from the central Command had changed the intelligence report and would be more optimistic about the war in Iraq and Syria against the state of war in the Islamic state.
The mid-term report comes from a group of special working groups organized by the House Military Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the House Grants Committee of the House Grants Committee, which says the central command analysts have "wide-ranging dissatisfaction" who said their superiors are being tampered with their assessment of the US and Islamic countries.
Cencom, a central headquarters in Tampa, Florida, is a military headquarters regulating U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a report on the report, "the description of the US counterterrorism operations is more optimistic than the actual situation," and has always been more optimistic than other intelligence agencies, through the audit of senior leaders of Central Command.
"The Central Command's behavior is difficult to accept. One is our warriors suffer from war, the other side is the wrong analysis of top policymakers," the Republican representative said.
The leadership of the central command has been extended to the highest level of the agency.
The report details the long-standing problems of the central Command in describing and analysing the U. S. military for the Iraqi military in 2014 and 2015.
Although there is no certainty indicating that senior officials of the Obama administration ordered changes to the reports, they felt that, according to the report, these analysts felt they were under pressure from central command leaders and forced them to make more optimistic comments on the threat of the Islamic State (ISISS or ISIL).
"In the first half of 2015, many central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimony are much better than actual situations," the report said.
An official from a central command, for example, openly expresses the possibility of taking a major military operation in April or May 2015 to recover Mosul.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompelo said in a statement: "After months of investigation, this results have been very clear."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most senior officials of the central Command have manipulated the headquarters of the Command and hide the threat of the Islamic state of Iraq.
The Republicans, who learned from analysts that intelligence about Islamic states had been manipulated, set up a group of special working groups.
As the survey continues, there will be more discoveries since the report released Thursday.
The Defense Attorney-General also conducted a long-term investigation into central command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released its findings on Thursday, consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican specialist team.
The Committee's Democratic Leader, Mr. Shinda, said in a statement that the central Command's intelligence assessment of Islamic state and Iraqi peacekeepers has worked out an over-narrow process between 2014 and 2015. "
Mr. Shuanda said the process "hampered the release of intelligence," reducing the morale of analysts and "unable to accept different opinions."
But Mr Sheikh and Democrats also said they did not find any evidence that the White House tried to put pressure on analysts from the central command, and their conclusions were in line with the "preset or political narrative."
The Beast Daily reported the initial results of the congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon Attorney General was investigating after receiving complaints from the Central Command analysts.
In a statement, the Pentagon spokeswoman Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Defense Department did not comment on the congressional report before the end of the prosecutor-general's investigation.
But, he said, "experts sometimes disagree about the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Defense Department encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security topics."
The impact of the survey has outweighed the success of the U. S. bombardment of bombings in Iraq and Syria, which is claimed by more and more defense officials.
But last year, these advocates challenged the public to question how much President Obama could trust in military action in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other troubled areas of the Central Command.
Critics of the Islamic national newspaper are reminiscent of the controversy over a decade ago, when the Central Command analyst Gregory Hook wrote a study that pointed out that George Bush's government, despite the opposition's opposition, insisted on sending small troops to Iraq and, almost not, to consider the 2003 invasion.
Mr Hooker played a key role in the opposition of the Islamic country's national state of affairs.
Last year, officials said Mr. Huoke's team had concluded that an air raid against the Islamic State's refinery did not slash the economic revenue of the terrorist group, since the terrorist group built a temporary refinery to continue selling oil in the black market, and that was quite different from the announcement it had announced.
The Central Command did not publicize this discovery according to the September report of the weekly weekly magazine.
The central commander, Lloyd Austen III, was criticized last year by the central commander, Lloyd Austin III, as a number of lawyers reviewed the testimony about the over-optimistic assessment of war.
General Austin retired in April and was now succeeded by Joseph Warren to replace him at the central command.
America won four victories in the women's hockey game and will be victorious with Britain.
Katie Bamm, a three-yuan victory over Japan in Japan on Thursday, took the lead in the US women's lacrosse team on Thursday, helping American teams to defeat India by 3 ratio of three to 0.
The two scores were scooter, but the 27-year-old Bumb said she did not know that she had such a good performance.
"I know nothing about it," she said.
I'm not the kind of person who will remember to have a few balls.
What she knew was that the US team had won four winners in the Olympic Games and the team of British teams that had won the team on Thursday after two more than two decades of defeat in the Japanese team after the Japanese team had failed to match the Japanese team.
The United Kingdom and the United States have met in the last round of the last race on Saturday.
Both teams were in the quarter-final quarterfinals, which would determine who was in the first position of the group.
Access to the team's first team will avoid a strong Dutch team that will be able to go far further. The Dutch team is in the first place.
In Saturday's match, the U. S. team created miracles in an amazing performance. The U. S. team was at the bottom of the twelve squad in the London Olympics four years ago.
And Bamm was in the time of the same team.
Bam grew up in Brubel, Pennsylvania, for the first time to pick up a hockey stick at the age of 3 (her twin sister in Draksel) and joined the national team at the age of 16 to become the youngest member of the country's national team.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she failed to win the final list.
In 2012, she and her teammates were not well known.
The next year, the British, Crag Panam, acted as a manager, and everything began to change.
"This is a culture, a mentality and a change in substance," said Mr Bamm.
We haven't reached the current level in London at that time.
We came to the bottom of a thorn and thoroughly.
On Thursday night, Mr. Bamm pulled out in the first half of an anti-hand shoot in the first half.
India has not yet tasted in this game, but the team has shown surprisingly tenacious tenacity and maintains a ratio of 1 to 0 to the end of the third quarter, when Bamm erupted.
She brought the ball along the left side of the pitch, then cut into the middle of the middle, pulled into the net, and the US team 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzales was shot in the fourth quarter in the middle of the fourth.
In the first three triumphs, the United States knocked Jackie Brigins out of the game for the first time in the first three triumphal triumphs.
This time she is too often played.
Bum is also.
"We're very good now," Mr. Panama says. "But how well it's going to depend on Saturday's match."
Choice food during the Great Depression during the Great Depression of the Great Depression
In March 1933, Mr. Franklin de Rano Roosevelt, who was elected president, was sitting in the presidential office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt likes Fifth Avenue cuisine such as goose liver sauce and Maryland stew fish.
That day, his menu was simple: tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and dried pudding as a snack.
"This is to get together with people who are suffering from the suffering," said Jane Zigman.
Her husband, Andrew Yifeng, said: "This also embodies the American way of eating."
This pair of couples living in Brooklyn's highlands were food historians.
Mr. Ko's last book "frizzy chatter" is about the U. S. Chinese meal, and Ms. Zigman, in her 997 orchard, tells the story of the slander tenant's life story.
The new book, which they co-prepared, will be published on Tuesday by Harper Publishing House, the book's food history in the Great Depression.
They met a reporter in Eisenberg's sandwich shop after displaying some of the food areas. The simple lunch counter in the ironing area had been running until the end of the nineteen twenty-nine.
Ms. Zigman, 54, points to a crushed olive sandwich, while Mr. Ko, 57 years old, points to turkey, potatoes and vegetable spelling.
The reporter points out a baking, the couple think these vegetables are suitable for discussion of the period of the Great Depression.
Ms. Zigman said: "The bread was very popular at that time."
Peanut bread, liver bread, and soybean bread were at that time.
They all use a raw material and a cheap doughnut that can be watered on the raw material.
Imagine that your dinner is a peanut.
Mr. Ko seemed to be a monster.
"They're sure they're just like lead in your stomach," he said.
In a few years before the Great Depression, Americans are buffet, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cook for the male farm, breakfast, lunch and dinner have just come out of the pie.
In the war, it was the Americans who gave food to hungry Europeans. The Fabrics had documented how the country had suddenly no longer become a friction.
Mr. Ko explained why he and his wife had to write this book: "At the time, food has become a major topic of unhappiness in the United States."
Another unpleasant topic is the new food: bread and stew foods, such as bread and stew, and stew is "best leftover cooking", Ms. Zigman says, because the cooks can use creamy cream in sauce to cover up the hard food.
Fresh fruit is replaced by a cheaper dry fruit.
The meat of the protagonist who has been a protagonist for years has become a rare luxury.
The odd chatter considered only calories, compared to the taste, even the basic cooking common sense, the first to think of nutrition.
In the study of this book, including a variety of recipes, Ms. Zigman produced a roasted onions filled with peanut oil.
"It is not common at dinner table at dinner," Mr. Koo said.
"It's too strange," Ms. Zigman said.
Peanut oil and roast onion can't match at all.
This is the characteristic of many family economic meals.
Family economists have influenced the country's dietary habits, such as Louis Steinley, a cochef of the Federal Family Economy Bureau, 1923 to 1943, which has never been in history.
They distribute recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines to encourage women to be "delicious" and dine with bad food such as carrots in spaghetti spaghetti.
The "Fabrics" is a rich "historical treasure" that is a rich "historical treasure."
Particularly noteworthy is the government's response to the hungry people, such as the President of the President Herbert Hoover, "I can't manage it."
Although he publicly praised his childhood, the simple Iowa farmhouse, his diet was like a millionaire's exquisite exquisite.
"He likes to eat European Western food, like cucumber sauce," says Mr. Ko.
He wore a evening dress and served in a gilded restaurant.
He was clearly out of the people.
If not wife Eleanor encouraged him to set an example on his diet, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
As the book says, the housekeeper employed by Ms. Roosevelt has no interest in taste, so the White House's "food is not only the most difficult food in Washington, but also the worst food for cooking."
When the United States comes back, the cooking style of many of the Great Depression is abandoned.
Ms Zigman says the left is our attention to calorie and nutrition and to the application of science to cooking.
The couple said that when they were writing the book, they gave a further understanding of Ms. Zigman's mother's eating habits, such as how she did not discard the food.
"She is very afraid to waste food," said Mr. Ko.
Ms. Zigman recalls: "She actually makes a lot of people ill."
For example, there has been a "cream puff" event once.
After withdrawing the dishes, she took out a dessert at home with Mr. Ko: that was the fruits that President Roosevelt ate during lunch.
"This is the fruit of cream," said Ms. Zigman, adding that a new tidal name for an ordinary dish is "customary tricks."
There is no cream in this dessert, and only fruit, a bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
It was hard for everyone to put the spoon into a thick brown paste.
Above all, the sweet smell of the dessert is good.
Mr. Ko ate a second more spoon and a third.
He felt that it was an acceptable dessert, and he told his wife: "It would be better to eat a walnut."
Unfortunately, the latest OPEC report showed that crude output continued to rise in July, with Saudi output reaching new highs.
The report gave the market a doubtful doubt on the credibility of OPEC, and the road to recovery was still full of thorns.
On Monday, the OPEC President-elect and Qatar Energy Minister Qatar said OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum of September 26-28 September.
OPEC reported Wednesday that the entire OPEC group, including Gabon, had produced 46,000 barrels / days in July to 33110,000 barrels / days.
OPEC also said in the monthly report that oil prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refineries, exacerbating the extent to which the market is supplying excess supplies.
The impact, coupled with the increase in the expectation of crude oil production and the unexpected increase in stockpiles of crude oil, is falling two days.
Light crude oil futures, which ended in September on the New York Mercantile Exchange, fell 2.48%, while London's Brent oil futures fell by 2.07 per cent in October.
Reuters believes that the proposed meeting of oil-producing countries is unlikely to tighten supply, and data released by the US Energy Information Department also crumble market sentiment.
On Wednesday, Iran's official news agency Fars quoted Iran's Minister of Oil, saying Iran's crude oil production has reached 3.85 million barrels a day, the highest since 2008.
At the meeting, the Russian energy minister, Nowak Nowak, said there was no need for a new round of frozen negotiations in the current oil price.
The last time the oil producer was meeting was April, the OPEC member countries failed to agree on any measures.
Emma Richards, an oil and gas analyst at BMIResearch, said the market and media could overtake the OPEC meeting.
Helima Croft, head of commodities strategy for the Canadian Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC changed sentiment in the market by releasing signals from them that would lead to an agreement.
It was like a smog and a mirror that inspired the eyes of people (deliberately to impress people).
EugenWeinberg, head of commodity research at German commercial bank commodity research, said the OPEC was expected to try to stabilize the market through September's meeting.
This is likely to further undermine the confidence of the market in OPEC, which has been a "wolf" in the organization after all.
It is necessary to release medical advertisements, complaints of complaints, as well as medical institutions that have been punishable by multiple punishments.
The State Health Planning Commission and the State Administration of Medicine shall organize timely and timely supervision of the specific supervision and inspection work of some provinces.
According to media disclosure, due to a massive influx of capital into Internet medicine, the investment boom has receded and capital entering the watchdog period.
According to data from the Hong Kong Eritrea Hospital Management Research Centre, the internet health companies in a year of entrepreneurial death have seen a lot of death, with about 20 per cent of the start-up.
However, at a time when most internet health-care companies have struggled on the financing of A or B rounds, companies in several segments of the subdivision still get capital featured.
It seems that internet health-care breaks can't be "a bottomless bee" but to see market demand, sink the heart and do deeper.
A total of $1200.million, representing 40 per cent of registered capital, was $18.06 million funded by nine state companies, accounting for 60% of registered capital.
In recent years, with the state's policy support in medical informationization, electronically integrated and integrated supply chain management system has gradually entered all at all levels.
The leap is aimed at the market's demand, helping the hospital build the advanced supply chain management system, and this is the opportunity to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many internet healthcare companies, iBaby is initially focused on the vertical domain of the internet obstetrics, the end of a farmed mother and doctor.
The pregnant nurse may not only be able to ask for a 24-hour and one-on-one doctor, but also pay for the diagnostic diagnosis.
At the doctor's end, iBaby, by taking an organizational expert, has been able to break down geographical limits in the form of online lectures, peer exchanges, case discussions, etc.

According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently said Ali's health "is willing to sink heart" to take health data.
Internet companies and data companies lack professionalism, and the writing method on the same phrase can not be uniformly united.
Ali's distribution in health health is divided into three pieces, namely Ali Health, Cat Cat Pharmaceutical Pavilion and the future hospital.
"It's not just a matter of how much money you have," Wang said. "It's not just how much money you have, but the heart, enduring loneliness."
For a continuous night watching Olympic events easily hurt the heart.
The Brazilian Games are undergoing a swindling event, and many citizens will stay up in the middle of the day even when they are broadcast at home.
In particular, doctors caution that the night's health hazard is likely to trigger cardiovascular disease.
If long overnight, the hormone will still have a lot of secretion, and people are in a state of intense excitement, unable to get normal recovery, causing blood vessels to constriction and blood pressure.
It is a particular reminder that a group of cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood fat, smoking habits, family disease history, etc., will be more likely to trigger cardiovascular disease if the night is too late.
If long-term overnight, not only is the cardiovascular function affected, the gastrointestinal function, immune system, neuroendocrine system will be affected, even the risk of tumor increases.
For elderly friends, Hancheng is far from going to stay up to stay up for Olympic games, especially in the history of cardiovascular disease.
During the last World Cup football game, Hwon was far more than a 60-year-old patient, with myocardial infarction triggered or associated with staying in the night.
Since this year, it has received some 25 years of myocardial infarction or cerebral stroke, a large part of the patient's long-standing life-style lifestyle, Hanoi said.
Do not stay late every day, occasionally watch the most favourite sports program, and other projects may wait for the next day to watch the game replay.

It is expected to launch the VR panoramic edition for the first time in the early next year in Central Television and Looking ahead.
The film "Polar" is a major work on the Earth's third pole of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, with a new perspective about Tibetan tradition and modernity and the interactions between Tibet and the world.
The biggest advantage of VR works is to give viewers a unique sense of "immersion", and this is also a higher requirement for the filming process.
The Polar VR Panoramic VR team says they need to ensure that every aspect of the image is impeccable and that the audience has a sense of contention.
On August 11, the Armed Police Shandong Total Team organized the Twitter Snipers at a high temperature of 34 degrees Celsius to launch jungle training.
During the cold war, the Soviet Union moved missiles into Cuba and nearly led to nuclear war in the US.
The incident was seen as the peak of the cold war, known as the "Cuban missile crisis."
But it was just as rare as the cold war during the cold war, and a strong solar storm had caused the US to launch a nuclear war against the Soviet Union until Aug. 9, which was not published by researchers for the first time on August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm caused strong interference with the U.S. military's radar and radio communications in the Arctic.
These radars are part of the American ballistic missile early-warning system used to monitor Soviet missiles.
It interviewed American military personnel who were involved in forecasting and analysing solar activities at the University of Colorado University in Colorado, and looked through the non-confidential literature.
In the 1960s, to prevent the Soviet Union from launching a nuclear war, the U. S. Air Force has always been part of a nuclear warhead flying in the sky, wrote the paper.
The U. S. military commander did not know that the sculpture was the sun storm, not the Soviet Union, and ordered the aircraft to enter the battle preparation.
Fortunately, the US military's study of solar activity started at the end of the 1950s and its research on Earth's electromagnetic disturbances, ultimately blocked the potential military conflict.
Later, he submitted a detailed report on the information provided by the U. S. Air Force Aerospace Service.
The direct consequence of the solar storms is that the U.S. military has since seen space weather as a war concern and a stronger space weather forecasting system has been established.
Members of the public found out that loving cars were hampered by unfamiliar vehicles, and they could use the "micro-messenger car" function to solve this beset by connecting with unfamiliar vehicle drivers.
On Aug. 11, Xi'an's micro-letter service, Xi'an, launched a "micro-letter truck" service.
In the aftermath of this service, people in everyday life, when familiar with unfamiliar vehicles, hindered their vehicles when they were not on site, could solve such problems by using the "micro-messaging car" function.
The functions of this new service are fast and fast, economizing on administrative costs; the second is respect for and protection of citizens' privacy; and three is all day and time service.
As long as the public has a micro-letter, it can be very easy to operate, which can make it more friendly and easy to meet, to ease parking difficulties, and to reduce the law of security in the car.
On the other hand, the authorities of Xian, who refused to move, illegally parked or impaired traffic, said that the police would take different measures in the light of the actual situation to deal with the situation.
On August 9, in Denfeng County County Town Cultural Tourism Tourism Area, more than 10 young workers in the company have come to work here to "meet the power of the ancient town of the electricity" and the festival Eve.
Danfeng County Co., Ltd., the company, combines the work of spiritual civilization and actively organizes the "Festival of the power of the ancient town" and the holiday.

On April 27, 2015, the US and Japan jointly published a new edition of the US-Japan Defense Cooperation Directory, allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role globally.
That was the day the U.S. Defense Secretary Carter Carter, Secretary of State of Secretary of State Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Showmann, and Japanese Defense Minister Valley Yuan Yuan attended a press conference in New York.
This is the fifth time in the Chinese folk think-tank to report Japan's military strength and its fourth edition of English.
The report is divided into nine chapters, including overall policy adjustments, military strength, defense budgets, military deployment, weaponry and institutional reform, military training, and military training in China, and other contents, including military security in China.
The report says the year 2015 is the year in which the Government of Abe has carried out major policy adjustments for several years in the security field.
Since then, Japan's measures in the security field will mainly be based on the use of legal, strategic implementation, policy implementation and other operational aspects rather than the major changes and changes in the framework, mechanisms and policies.

Short Plates of Public Sports Facilities
The black field warehouse becomes "green grass" football stadium; the red brick steeple factory becomes a modern gymnasium.
At the National Health Day, the South Locksport Sports Culture Park, outside Hangzhou, opened the mysterious veil.
It was a coal field, a dozen years after closed, leaving a large number of law-breaking buildings and livelihood garbage.
After being remedied, it became a sports culture park and will be open to the public in November, providing free venues for the public, and there is no doubt that national sports have opened up new warmth.
This reminiscent of Changshan Body School in Hangzhou, where the "Huangpo Army School" swims out of a number of world champions.
The repository of swimming, which gives birth to the relationship between athletic sport and universal sports, offers good conditions for selecting professionals.
The level of athletic sports is closely related to the foundation of universal sports, and competitive sports depends on universal sport, and universal sport depends on the conditions of the site.
China's per-capita average of sports space has been reported to be 150 times as much as New China in 2015, but is still far behind the sporting power.
In June, the State Council issued the National Fitness Plan (2016-2020), which will develop mass sports as key elements.
In order to plug the short board, the authorities need to take full account of the layout of stadiums when planning urban planning.
On the other hand, the established public stadiums, including schools such as schools, should maximize open scope and improve the efficiency of their use as far as possible.
The Rio Olympics, which is now under way, inspires people's enthusiasm for movement and awakens their participation in the sense of participation.
Gilidd obtained lawyers' fees in the battle for hepatitis C of Merck's Phepatitis
According to the Judge of the U. S. District Judge, Gilde Science has the right to obtain lawyers' fees produced in a patent litigation filed with the drug company in Merck, the drug company.
In June, when U.S. judges discovered that Merck had illegal behaviors, including perjury and other immoral acts, Gilede exempted $200 million from $200 million from Gilild's best-selling drug Sofio and Havoni's inviolability of two patents from Merck.
In Thursday's lawsuit, Judge Bace Lambon Freeman, a U.S. judge, said Gilly had no need to take charge of the cost of the defense.
Merck is trying to chase Gild Giled, in a new generation of hepatitis C, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with hepatitis.
The case was traced back to 2013, when Gilde and Merck prosecuted each other, both claiming that they were an effective ingredient in the Gilly medication, the laboratory of the Laboratory of Sordon.
U.S.-backed forces announced that they had recovered Manbie from the Islamic State.
A force spokesman said on Friday that the remnants of the remnants of the city were all left, and United States support forces have fully controlled the northern city of Manbie, near the Turkish border.
The Syrian Democratic Power (SDF) is now sweeping out of the city after the militants in the city left the city.
Sharan Dalglish of the Syrian Democratic Confederation of Democracy in Syria has told Reuters that they have rescued more than 2,000 civilians hijacked by militants.
He told Reuters: "Manchester season is under our control, but we're still moving."
The Clinton couple earned $10.75 million in 2015, and paid 34.2% of federal tax.
Hillary Clinton released its 210-year tax return on Friday, indicating that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband's income in 2015 amounted to $10.75 million and paid 34.2 percent of federal taxes.
In 2015, the amount of philanthropic donations of the Clinton couple totaled $1 million, most of which gave the Clinton Foundation a speech to the former President Bill Clinton at nearly $5.3 million, while former Secretary of State earned $3 million in income from Simon Simon, publisher of her office in the State Council, and Schuster.
Clinton's campaign mate, Senator Tim Kane, and his wife Anne Holton, announced 10 years of tax returns.
The two people pay 20.3% federal tax in 2015.
Clinton's campaign assistant, Jennifer Palmeyi, said in a statement that Hillary Clinton and Tim Kahn will continue to be a financially transparent pole.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump concealed with false reasons and recovered his commitment to announce a tax return statement before he had made it.
Although the law does not require, but in accordance with established practice, the presidential candidates should open their tax returns.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyers use the auditing of the National Tax Bureau as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
The Clinton campaign assistant, Ian Sam, said in Twitter that you were the owner, and attached a single link to the Democratic candidate's tax declaration.
On Thursday, Trump's special legal adviser Michael Cohen told CNN that he wouldn't allow Trump to announce tax returns before the audit was completed.
Critics of Trump, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, and other Republicans say Trump's refusal to release tax returns will trigger doubts about its capital worth, charitable donations, commercial transactions and other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton grabbed the problem and released a network of videos on Friday, highlighting high-profile Democrats urging Trump to disclose its tax.
On Thursday, she raised the issue in an economic policy speech in Michigan.
"Over the past few decades, he has refused to publicize his tax returns as other presidential candidates," she said for the rest of the year.
Trump has not paid a penny for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quotes many tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, saying that the current situation is likely to be the case.
The federal tax has become a big problem in the presidential campaign.
With the name of Warren Buffett, a billionaire investor, Clinton named a rule that guarantees at least 30% of those who earn more than $1 million a year.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, at Berkshire Hazardo, where Mr. Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns at the meeting.
Mr. Buffett says he is also accepting IRS's auditing, Trump "is not a tax authority, but voters."
The earliest tax returns released by Clinton's campaign team were 2007.
The Clinton couple living in ChabBark, New York, paid about 32 per cent in the average federal tax rate between 2007 and 2014, at about 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton couple's tax returns in 2015 show that, unlike most Americans, they pay only $100 for their wages.
Their main investments are low-cost exponential mutual funds, and the couple's dividend and interest income is $109,000.

Jewish filmmakers criticised the Berlin Hotel for deleting Israeli telephone code from the Arab customers - Reuters News
A French film producer with Jewish origin told the media that the Kininski Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's phone code, and the hotel staff said it was a "demand" in the Arab customers, which sparked an outcry for public opinion.
Claude Runzman, author of the Holocaust documentary of Jewish Holocaust, expressed his disappointment at the Kinkinski Hotel and published an open letter in Germany's Frankfurt Reports.
During the recent stay, Luzman wants to find Israel on a list of telephone code lists offered by the hotel.
But Israel is not listed in the country where guests can speak directly from the room.
Isn't Israel in the capital of Germany in 2016?
"he writes.
Instead, the guest can call Israeli phone calls through the Kinkinski Hotel's call center.
To seek explanations, the filmmaker questioned the front desk of the hotel.
Mr. Longzman said in his letter that he was "shocked" by the answer he received at the front desk.
The hotel staff said it was "the decision taken by the management of Kininski Hotel."
And the reason for doing so is that the filmmaker is angry.
Ronzman quotes the employee as saying that most of our guests are Arabs and they call for the deletion of Israeli code. "
According to the Southern Daily report, Israel's Ambassador to Germany, Jacov Hadas Hiddlesmann, described the matter as "a humiliating humiliation."
We were shocked by the fact that the incident was to be heard.
The matter itself is an immense stigma.
What happened in Germany and the chain of chains was even more disrespectful.
There is no need for this to explain.
"We hope the hotel is able to draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a hot deal on the Internet, and everyone thought it was a scandal.
Some people think the Kinkinski hotel is simply to meet the demands of Arab clients, "humble."
Another poster refers to the hotel "really not the face", and points out that the street in the famous Kumam Avenue is near a synagogue near the synagogue.
The hotel quickly clarified all allegations, claiming that everything was "negligent" and "apologized" to Langzman, according to the report of the Menoscopic Week.
The Nancy Daily quoted Mr Kininski's representative: "There has never been a direct order to delete Israel from the Quick dial list."
The newspaper also says Israel's code has been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets expulsion of Brazilian students
Thursday, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, students clashed with police in protest against the reform of the government's public education system.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesters.
The incident was due to the attempt by law-enforcement officials to disperse students, so police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students participated in the parade, expressing their dissatisfaction with these programmes.
In order to save money, Sao Paulo Governor Oken plans to close 100 public schools, and 300,000 students will be resigned.
Some protest students expressed their dissatisfaction with the temporary President Michelle Telmeer through the graffiti on the wall.
Just a few days before the latest protest, protesters collectively walked up the streets and supported the president's impeachment president Dilma Rossev.
Kim Skinner, Scottish cyclist, won a reputation after winning bike gold medals.
Kim Skinner, Scottish cyclist, last night helped the UK win the gold medal in the Olympic Games after the 2012 London Olympic Games in the Rio bicycle.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist replaced his Scottish compatriots, Sir Chris Houey, as a junior in the queue. Young Skinner defeated the winning New Zealanders, and even the legendary drivers were proud of him.
Four years ago, the British team was astonished and Hoy won the fifth Olympic gold medal in the Olympic gold medal.
The British team was only sixth in London's World Car Championships in March, and Houey was retiring. Then the British team created the brilliance.
During the Beijing Olympics to London, the British team's problem was to change the "first circle of experts" Jamie Starf.
The convoy did what he did when he appeared in Hindu.
Hoey's retired retirement also left a blank, while Chiang Imadi and Matt Krpton wanted to fill the gap.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the British Teachers' Teaching team insisted on winning the national team, and Skinner ended up not looking at it.
Skinner's partner, Cynthes and Kenneth, who won the gold medal four years ago, refreshed the Olympic record in the qualifier, but the first round was overtaken by the New Zealanders.
The three British cycling games finally defeated their opponents, winning gold medals.
While Hindles had a little backward, Kenny was leading the team, and Skinner kept the leading advantage at the end of the day.
Strategic changes are the key to this reversal, and Hindz chooses a larger flywheel so speed is slower, and that makes Kenny, especially Skinner, how fast it is to keep pace.
He watched the game as a BBC commentator. Skinner, Kenny Kenny and Hindez saw him when they landed on the podium.
The 23-year-old Glasgow driver, Skinner, said: "This makes me flattered."
I can only do what I can, and make myself known to be a million.
We created the Olympic record in the final and defeated the world champion.
It's incredibly incredible.
Nothing is better than the triumph.
After winning gold medals with Kenny and Joe at the 2012 Olympics in London, Hindz admitted deliberately falling down on the track in the absence of a poor start.
Later, he withdrew the comment, and the British team's opponents were unable to appeal.
There is no such thing as any such victory.
"This is like the British flag on the platform, in London," said Mr Hindz.
We just set up the team three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world champions, so it's surprising to defending the Olympic championship.
It's just a game and a gold medal for the seven British teams that won the gold medals at the Beijing Olympic Games and the London Games.
If this symbolizes the progress we have made over the past five months, we will continue to succeed in the bike for the next five days.
According to Kenny's state, he is not likely to renew the feat that Joe won three gold medals at the Olympic Games.
If this is the case, more than 12 years younger than Joe and on March 23 (this day seems to be a sacred day of British sports, Steve Redgruff, Mo Fara and Roger Bennie) will have six golds and a silver medal in Kenny, who is born on this day.
The accomplishments and hooks were flat.
Kenny will come to the beginning of a three-day race today to start a three-day race.
"I'm going to focus on the game for a while," said the 28-year-old Bolton.
The team races are always the best.
You can win the game with your teammates.
Frankly speaking, a man's victory is a little lonely.
"If he could win two more gold medals, he would have been awarded the jazz seal," Mr Hindz said.
It was the only day for a medal of medals, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wigins, Ad Cransi, Steven Berk, Steven Burke and Owen Dure chased four people at the fastest grades.
Their grades were 351.94.
The world record for gold medals for the London 2012 Olympics was 351.695.
The first round and finals (at 10: 42 p.m.) today took place in the second game today, and Wikins will undoubtedly be the focus of attention.
Yesterday he broke a dispute with the competition officials, when the game officials asked him to measure his height.
In a female group that will end tomorrow, Laura Trotte, Joanna Roser Squader, Eleanor Buck and Kate Archboulder, from the Mir Gate, set up 413.260 in a new world record.
The British team relied on its strong venues to take the initiative in the middle of the Games and capture multiple medals.
After an absolute dominance in Beijing and the London Olympics, the British convoy was disappointed in the process of travelling to Rio.
There had been a lot of pumps, including April technology director Sean Saton, resigned by sex discrimination and bullying charges and the retirement of legendary characters such as Houey, Victoria Pendleton.
But the first game in the bicycle was enough to prove that the British team would replay the saga of its pinnacle.
After the little life came to this world, Mom and Dad wanted to be responsible for this life, not only in the health of the children, but in the spirit of spiritual development, and education.
If you fail in the education of children, even if the cause is successful, it can't compensate for the shortcomings of life and the failure of the family.
When a new life comes down, new parents will take time to take time to look at and educate their children and take responsibility for him.
Responsibility, besides embodied in the health of the body, makes them healthy, as well as spiritual education, is to make children learn how to do people, how adults, and how successful they are.
Good family education means parents need often to accompany children, to care for their children, to care patiently, to teach children to cultivate the words of civilization, let the children better learn knowledge and enhance intellect.
Parents will affect their children's growth, and they will imitate their parents, who are often said to be dragon dragons, phoenix phoenix, mouse's son, what kind of child is like.
So parents need to be a good example in front of their children, regulate their own words and cultivate their excellence, which can help the child shape a good heart and make him better.

I tried to make Amy a practice, allowing her to calm down through the breathing way to calm herself down and feel the torment.
And once she left the constellation situation, she felt herself relaxed and regained her freedom.

The head of the National Development and Reform Commission's Industrial Coordination Commission said here that overcapacity is a global problem.
China's capacity rate of capacity in recent years is higher than the global average, and higher than the US and Europe.
My country has taken resolute and effective measures to defuse excess capacity, and the results are gradually emerging.
The head of the party points out that the Central Party Council attaches great importance to the global problem of excess steel capacity.
Departments and regions have actively implemented the implementation of the State Council and work hard to reduce the amount of crude steel by around 45 million tonnes this year.
Proceeding from our national conditions, China does not encourage the export of steel, but also adopted a series of practical measures to control the export of steel.
The director stressed that the international trade in steel is essentially a market act, which originates from an independent choice of factors such as the demand from importing countries, consumers' comprehensive consideration of product price ratio.
The implementation of measures to protect the global steel industry will not help fundamentally solve the development problems of the global steel industry, but it will only have a further impact on the international trade order.
Turning to debt, the director stressed that the problem of dissolving the debt problem needed to be properly dealt with in the process of excessing excess capacity.
Because of the large scale of the assets of steelmakers, a wide range of branches of debt, the debt relationship of some enterprises is complicated, it is possible to trigger regional risks.
According to the Director, in recent years, as the downward pressure on the economy has increased, the overall demand for social needs has gradually eroded, and some sectors of the industry have been declining in capacity utilization.
Some companies do not adapt to market conditions, and production can not be sustainable or even close to bankruptcy, but it is constrained by some institutional mechanisms, and has become a "zombie corporation".
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces the efficiency of the utilization of factors, increases the cost of social management, and prevents the establishment of fair competition market conditions.
The main reason for losing losses is like the plight of the global steel industry 鈥? the lack of market demand and low capacity utilization.
China mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic instruments and rules of the rule of law, and the government is mainly well prepared for the work of the workers and the social stability and ensuring fair and equitable market order.
The director stressed that the next step was to unswervingly continue to work in capacity, to ensure the completion of the five-year coarse steel production target of 100 ~ 150 million tonnes.

As the first round of twelve rookies in 2014, Sarkozy will go to the NBA next season and join the Philadelphia 76 team.
Saraci was a young European player, and many fans were not well aware of him, but through the Olympics, he believed that Mr Sari's performance had left a deep impression on people.

In the first half, Sarkozy showed his ability to pull space on the pitch, and he could shoot the basket out of a three-point line after his teammate's blockage was removed.

As the NBA today's labour agreement is about to enter the last year, as vice president of NBA players, James will be at the forefront of the labor agreement talks.

The future of the Portland smelter is full of uncertainty over the cancellation of power contracts
As power companies for factories have disclosed that a factory owner will terminate a supply contract, it will invalidate all supply contracts, which are now facing an uncertain future in the Victorian Russian-owned smelter, and hundreds of factories in the factory.
The move took place after the Victorian government decided not to continue issuing subsidies for the operation of plants.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will terminate in November.
The 2,000 workers in the Beautland plant in the United States may face unemployment.
Once the factory is closed, there may be up to 2,000 people directly or indirectly.
And because the plant's use of electricity accounts for about 10% of Victoria's total power output, it may also have a chain reaction.
In 2014, the company closed the smelter of Han Ki, which led to the closure of the Angel Island power plant last year.
The company's Portland smelter is now losing money and facing the risk of closing it.
The move was taken after a few years of forecasting factories in the coming years, initially due to the strength of the Aussie dollar and recently because of the price of factory products.
AGL provides electricity to the big aluminium smelters through the Ratrob Valley's old Epoplasy plant, which predicts that all three other factories will also end their agreements.
The largest shareholder in the factory is a joint venture with a Chinalco and alumina company, while China's Citic Group and Japan's Manuel Wushong Society also hold a small share of shares.
"AGL expects the Portland factories to continue to operate, meaning that the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand," said the joint venture.
AGL said the contracts were supposed to be "hedging contracts" that should be effective since November 2016.
The expiration of contracts is 12 months, so they will terminate in 2017.
"So AGL is still predicting that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in the year 2017," the power company said.
Any impact on AGL's potential income from the fiscal year 2018 is now subject to the futures market's optimistic outlook on wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says the company has lost value of $187 million in terms of "termination of its activities."
It says the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect the ability of Aluminan to operate the smelter or to guarantee the power supply of the smelter."
The US company said it signed a 20-year contract with Old Young, which would have entered into force in November, but the company did not explain why the contract was withdrawn.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland smelter in Victoria, as well as the Tommao factory near Newcastle, will be cautious as a result of the poor economic situation.
In response to analysts earlier this week, Stephen Mikelson, head of AGL operations, said Portland's electricity consumption of about 600 megawatts a year was about 600 megawatts, reaching about 900 megawatts.
If the two factories were closed, the demand for the power market would be drastically reduced.
"As an electric power company, it's not a good news for us," he said.
The community legal center has rejected 160,000 people every year.
More than 160,000 disadvantaged groups have been dismissed from the community legal center each year, and this service has been scrapped and is now faced with further financial cuts.
In Queensland, three of the five persons were denied access to free legal counselling and agency services, most of which were the victims of the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, and those who had no resources to combat unfair expulsion.
The lack of funds for community legal services has already exceeded limits and is now faced with further financial cuts.
The federal government's funding for these legal centres will be reduced by 30 per cent since June of next year.
James Farrell, the head of the Queensland community law center, says thousands of people have been rejected every year according to the latest National Community Association Legal Center.
Mr. Farrell said that the situation would only become worse if the federal government did not change its existing decisions.
"Queensland's community legal centre has long been underfunded, meaning that thousands of people will not be able to get the important services they need," he said.
Those who need to stay away from the violence, those who are unable to repay the huge debts, and those who are faced with disintegrating families and squeezed workers are faced with legal problems, and the report shows that they are not able to obtain the help they need.
The federal government will cut its funds by 30 per cent since June 2017, meaning that the thousands of vulnerable groups in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal problems in the absence of help.
We call on the Attorney General and Queensland Representative George Brandez to repeal the decisions to cut money, allowing people to get the help they need when facing legal issues.
Last year the state pledged to raise legal aid funds to the state's average level.
It is now important to focus on community law centres and to meet the needs of communities, and the Government must also be involved in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign has been prosecuted by a staff member as a result of his staff.
NEW YORK: Trump's campaign team pulled out a jeep for a staff member after he drove a jeep in February in February to a staff member.
Vincent Bodini, former software trainer for the state campaign team, describes the incident on Wednesday in Charlotte's state court.
Mr Bordini said he hoped that the matter would be resolved internally, but he was waiting for months to realize that "this could not happen."
According to Bordini, the head of the famous Earl Philip "pulled out a pistol, placed the right finger on the board, and fired the gun at Vincent's knee bone."
After complaining to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bodini learnt that at least four people had experienced the same thing in the opponent.
Bordini said in the complaint: "No shooting does not mean that it will cause harm."
Just two days ago, the Republican presidential candidate told the crowd in North Carolina that if his rival, Hillary Clinton was elected and choosing the judge she loved, then "supporters of the Second Amendment", that is, the gunmen and gunmen could take action, a statement that triggered a statement.
Trump's campaign team said he did not advocate violence in the media for his words.
In the complaint, Bordini asked the campaign to compensate for his oversight, while also demanding that Philip compensate for his assault, beatings and mental damage.
The Trump spokeswoman Hopp Hicks did not immediately respond to the news.
It's not up to Philip.
Philip left the campaign recently to leave the campaign, according to a local news agency WCCB in Charlotte's local news agency.
The Innovative Consulting Services, his consulting firm, did not respond immediately to the incoming electricity.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign team has been controversial.
In the case of Bordini and President Trump's campaign company, 16-CS-14300, Megenburg County (Charlotte), the High Court of Justice.
The British must pass the Olympic spirit and expand at Heathrow airport.
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our community, London and the nation as a whole.
For me, this is the glamour of Heathrow, just as in the 2012 London Olympics, we do everything we can to ensure that our country and the region benefit from these events.
The Games have benefited Stratford and the East.
And we will create the region again by creating opportunities for the local people and businesses near Heathrow to benefit the region again.
For only our local community, we will create 10, 000 new apprenticeship posts, 40,000 new jobs and let the young people around the airport get rid of the plight of unemployment.
Just as in the 2012 London Olympics, some people think Heathrow's expansion works too large.
I was told that Britain would be unable to prepare for the Olympics and we would be disgraced around the world.
Quality suspects are wrong about the 2012 Olympics, and their suspicions about the Heathrow project will prove to be wrong.
Although there is always an obstacle to the need to overcome, Heathrow is tackling every problem facing it.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for most people rather than a minority.
The expansion of the project will create an economic growth of up to 180,000 new jobs, bringing about ￡211 billion in ￡211 billion, leaving a technology and a job wealth around the airport.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team, which has been punctual and has completed 11 billion infrastructure investment projects within the budget, including the T5 terminal for five consecutive years of the world's best airport terminal and the T2 terminal between the world's busiest run-off runway.
Now they are ready to build a third runway with 锟? bn of private investment.
Britain successfully held the 2012 London Olympics, and I believe that the expansion of Heathrow Airport will also have a great success.
It is a good time for us to deliver the Olympic spirit and to expand Heathrow airport, so we can save our future convoys and create a wealth of technology and employment that is proud of the whole Britain.
Lord Paul Dayton is Chairman of Heathrow Airport and former British Treasury Secretary Business Counsellor Counsellor
A woman suicide and was killed on the Swiss highway.
The victim lay on the highway at midnight.
The woman who tried suicide was tossed on a motorway on the highway Thursday morning, and police are looking for witnesses.
The incident took place on A1 on the A1 highway near Mollen, Texas, Thursday.
Police in Werstate said a woman was "despairing" in the middle of the night and was overrun by a number of vehicles.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman whose behavior was apparently suicidal. She was tossed by a number of cars, including a truck.
The woman died on the spot.
Police say a number of drivers have been investigated, but some of the drivers have not been confirmed. Police are calling on them and eyewitnesses to be asked to come to the inquiry.
Jia Hofstette, a lawyer, told the Geneva Tribune that the criminal investigation was now under way, which is the routine process of such events.
But it is not yet known whether the drivers face accusations.
Is it possible to avoid collision?
"This will be determined by the prosecutor," says Mr Howard Steel.
Based on the results of two other similar cases in the past five years, the pilot will not be liable.
The paper reported that the two cases were caused by the late night to get out of the highway. The final decision was that the driver could not expect a pedestrian to cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was charged with negligent death, alleging that in August 2014, she struck a man and killed a man on the A1 highway near Payne.
The court was informed that the 22-year-old victim crossed the road after drinking.
The policeman, after the inquiry, said that the policeman was perfectly legal, and the man was "totally unexpected and unpredictable" on the road, and the policeman dialed the emergency phone afterwards.
Anyone who can provide information on the incident near Molday should be dialed at 0216,488446 or 0216,4444 444 contact police.
NASA climate model: Venus used to fit human habitat.
According to the NASA new climate model, Venus is suitable for human inhabitation.
Scientists at NASA Gordon Institute have developed a model that can explore Venus past conditions, and the tools and algorithms used by the model are very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine the surface high temperature, no water and the atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide, which once had a similar environment.
Previously, scientists believe Venus's rotating speed is slower because its atmosphere is thicker.
But the latest simulation shows that Venus may have had a thinner, similar atmosphere similar to the Earth's atmosphere and the speed of self-rotation at the time.
The model can also show the early terrain of Venus.
Venus's dry area may be more than the earth, but once there has been enough water and geological change to breed life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early, sunshine brightness on Venus was 30 percent more brightness than the earth.
In a news conference, Anthony del Dennio, scientist at Goradde Institute of Space Research, explained: "In the model simulation of the Goradde Institute of Space Research, the slow rotation of Venus has prolonged the day for nearly two months."
This made the surface warm and produced rainwater that could form thick clouds, and thick clouds, like an umbrella, blocked much of the sun's heat for the ground.
The result of the simulation is that Venus's average climate temperature is actually lower than the Earth's right now.
The simulated Venus evolution of the model is similar to the previous planetary scientists speculating.
Although Venus may have existed on the planet, in billions of years, Venus exposed the high temperature to ultraviolet rays.
The planet's oceans evaporate, water vapour is also burned by ultraviolet light.
With hydrogen escaping, there is only a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse gas effect, which forms the Venus that we know today.
The researchers published the simulation results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Newsletter.
Patrick Roy resign from the avalanche boss's job.
Patrick Roy, who resigned on Thursday as chief manager and vice president of the Colorado avalanche ice team, said he had no say in the team's decision-making level.
Joe Sachs, executive vice president of Colorado's executive vice president, confirmed the news and said the club would start looking for new coaches immediately.
"Over the past three years, I have performed with vigour, passion and determination to meet the coach and vice president of the Colorado avalanche," said Mr Roy, fifty years old.
I conscientiously thought about how to improve this team throughout the summer, making it the power of a more upstairs building.
To this end, the manager's goal of the manager and vice president must be consistent with the club's goals.
He must also have a voice in the decisions that influence the team's performance.
However, these conditions are not met at present.
Mr. Sachs hiring Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick has told me of his decision today," said Mr Sachs.
We thanked him for his contributions to the club and hoped that he would be smoothly sailing in the future.
In 2013-14, Roy was nominated for the best coach Jack Adams's best coach in the first season of the avalanche of avalanche.
He helped the club get 112 points, in central part of the middle, but Colorado was the first round of the playoffs to be eliminated by the Minnesota team, both in the last two years and in the aftermath of the playoffs.
In the 2015-16 season, the avalanche of avalanche is 39 wins 339, which eventually lost the second external-card qualification in the Western Union's big coalition zone.
As the goalkeeper of the celebrity Hall, Roy won four stallions of stallions of stalks to get two of the Montreal Canadians and avalanche teams.
Workers in the North Sea Oilfield stop strike and continue negotiations
The chief negotiator said the leaders of the North Sea oilfield stopped the strikes on pay, and the parties began a new round of talks.
On the North Sea oil platforms run by Dutch Shell, several times a strike against Wood Group, the oil service company.
According to a joint statement, "Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions are able to confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of resolving the current dispute."
We will start as early as next week and take a full number of days in the next few weeks to re-examine these issues.
The union said it had recently taken action to protest the highest possible amount of 30 per cent, which was the first time trade unions had taken for the first time in 25 years.
Wood Group has reduced its rewards for North Sea contractors this year by market pressure by about 9 per cent.
Prior to the reduction, the company has reduced its compensation by sea contractors by 10% in 2014.
The company says additional pay cuts will help the company through the depression of the market.
Shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to close oil and gas equipment to close 10 countries, because companies need to streamline their operations after merging with British energy companies in the UK.
Energy companies are facing a drop in prices from crude oil prices and June's European takeover.
Dave Anderson, member of Scottish parliament members, met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the largest labour dispute in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea is crucial for the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and the whole country," Dave said in a statement, "we need a kind of service to most people rather than a minority of the economy."
In 2016, spending on new projects is expected not to exceed $1.4 billion, compared with an average of about $7 billion in spending over the past five years.
Kepler measured the speed of rotation of the stars of the Star Star
The latest mission of the Cappler Space Telescope helped astronomers collect the fastest rotation velocity of the star.
New data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster have different velocity of rotational velocity and correlation between cycles and planets.
"We hope by comparing our results with other clusters to further understand the relationship between the quality of stars, age, even the history of our solar system," said Louisa Rebul, a research center at the Institute of Infrared Treatment in Pasadinna.
Aung San Suu Kyi was far from the Earth 445 light years.
Many stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, and they just reached an annual stage of adulthood.
They reach the highest rate of self-rotation in their lives.
These mature stars shoot a large number of stars when they reach the maximum speed of the rotation.
When these stellar wind winds through the magnetic field of the star, they can brake the stars.
As the age of the star increases, its velocity begins to slow.
Kepler used the time to measure the velocity of the stars by tracking some of the other stars, like sunspots, as sunspot.
The latest rotational velocity data sets show that the rotation of larger stars is slowing faster than the smaller stars.
Mr Rebul likens stars to a dancer, and the larger dancers of the body rotate slowly in the smaller body of the dancer.
"In a ballerina performances," Mr Rebul said, "we found that the slower-speed stars tend to be more mass, and the fastest star is often the lightest star."
Due to the close distance of the Daw Dung, it can serve as an ideal cosmic laboratory for a comparative star.
"Aung San Plant has laid the foundation for the two-way rotation theory of young and elderly stars," Mr Rebul said.
We still have a lot of knowledge about how stars, when and why slowing their rotation speed and "pick up their own dancing shoes."
Rebul and her colleagues elaborate on their latest analysis of the speed of their rotation of the Adobe Mission. These three papers will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
Zheng Zheng, director of the South Lake Park Water Management Section, introduced that the bottom of the south lake was more than 10 meters, and the water was likely to occur.
"Although the South Lake rescue team is very professional, it still wants large rowing tourists to wear a lifejacket, don't do irregularities, safely play," Zheng said.
The Village Village has a unique marine environment and has two major leisure tourism resources in the natural ecology and human ecology.
"But we buy individual owners of the neighborhood, fear that doing so will affect their car position, also doubt that others have self-interest, so it has been sabotage, leading to the reformation of the car.
As for when the potatoes are introduced to the problem, the theory of academia is still intriguing.
In the current mainstream view, the introduction of the potatoes mainly has three routes.
The widest, broadest spread in the three routes introduced by the potatoes is the introduction of the Philippines to Fuzhou by the Philippines.
The office of the public organization of the Beijing Municipal Government will conduct special examination on the unified receipts and receipts of social organizations.
The inspection shall be divided into two types of units self-examinations and key examinations.
Zhang Deguang, director of the Municipal Welfare Department, introduced the range of social organizations with the unified receipts and receipts of social organizations from 2013 to 2015 in the city.
"The success of the Olympics is definitely defined by people who share stories in the social media," the Rio COMCOG said in 2012.
According to the report of the Olympic Games, the media, in terms of communication mode, product morphology, language style, and information perspectives, have done much more than they have ever done.
The IOC and the media practitioners of the world seem to have been greeted with the challenge.
On Aug. 11, Light Securities Hall came into the last day. There was a message that the first two days of the market responded flat. Under the plan, it would be listing on Aug. 18 in Hong Kong, according to the plan.
According to a domestic brokerage analyst, Oriental Securities is not good at the Hong Kong base, and its capital management is an East Certificate. It appears to be insufficiently understandable compared with securities firms such as Silver International, Citic Securities.
Experts say there has been a decline in the stock market as a result of the return of the securities market this year, but many brokerages have gone down, but the company will be more likely to see developments in its own business after the company is listing.
After the regulation of the New Deal, Suzhou will become the first second-tier city to restart a qualifier.
The introduction or upcoming market regulation policy is more than Suzhou, including fertilizer, Nanjing, etc.
Previously, Fertilizer had taken the lead in issuing a loan policy, and the bank would refuse to offer a mortgage loan for two suites under fertilizer and a home loan that had not been liquidated in a home.
