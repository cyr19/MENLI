The 28-year-old cook was found dead in a shopping mall in San Francisco
A 28-year-old cook recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a stairwell in a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother said he could not think of anyone who would want to harm him, saying, "It's all at last."
The San Francisco test said the body found on Wednesday morning at the Nishida shopping centre was confirmed as the 28 year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco police station says the death case has been found to kill him and is investigating.
Louis Galicia, the victim's brother Louis Galicia, told Radio KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who made a pipeline chef in Boston six months ago, found an ideal job for a line chef in Sons & amp; Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Restaurants said they were "very shocked" about Frank's death.
"We are a small team with a family of close friends, and we will miss him deeply," the spokesman said.
At this sad moment, we express our deep sympathy and condolences to the family and friends of Frank.
Louis said Frank initially lived in a guest house, but recently "everything was finally good."
Louis Galicia told KGO: "Frank finds an apartment while engaging with a girl."
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to kill his brother.
Frank has a kind heart and a broad mind.
"Frank often cooks dinner for his family," says Louis Galicia.
He was never willing to quarrel with his family.
He is a man who follows everyone's opinion.
"All things in the world are likely to go wrong," said Louis Galicia, who said Frank is a person who shines every day. "
There are clues to call the San Francisco police station to call 415-575-4444.
Primary doctor's strike: Call for new labour action
The representative of the primary doctor called on the Alliance to approve its new labour action against new contractual disputes.
The Medical Association of British Medical Associations will require all its members to start supporting more labour action since the beginning of September.
The primary doctor's committee said the ministers had failed to address the concerns about the contract.
The primary doctor and medical students voted in July to boycott the contract deal with British Medical Association.
Of the members participating in the vote, 58 per cent were against the contract.
A letter from Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the Primary Health Care Committee, said in a letter on Twitter late Thursday that the Government had "kept silent" with regard to the issue of resistance to the contract.
She said: "In the light of this, the Executive Committee of the Primary Health Care Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract and call for a resumption of formal consultations on all concerns."
In response to the Government's silence, the Executive Committee of the Primary Health Care Committee today formally requested the Council of the British Medical Association to convene special sessions to approve a long-term plan to upgrade labour operations from early September.
This dispute has led to the participation of primary doctors in six strikes this year, including the first comprehensive strike on the history of the British National Medical Service.
Dr. Johann Malawana, a junior doctor of the British Medical Association, resigned after a boycott of the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the British Medical Association.
In the meeting before the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students, he said that he had said that the deal was good and should therefore be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said the contract would be enforced in England's medical staff.
Russia and Turkey: "Alien Alliance"?
A gesture put an end to a crisis.
The Russian and Turkish leaders met Tuesday with the Turkish leaders, shaking hands and announcing the official closure of eight months of quarrels and economic sanctions.
But I felt a strong feeling, however, when Vladimir Putin met with the Turkish President in a grand hall of the palace of St Petersburg, where I had a strong feeling that this reconciliation was one of Ankara's most hopeful signs.
Yes, the two sides really shook hands.
But even as Mr Putin has always said, Putin is just a shallow smile, almost unenthusiastic.
The Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was reported to have referred five times to "good friend" Putin.
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised that his relationship with Russia would return to pre-crisis levels even higher.
The next day, the newspaper wrote that Mr Erdogan had behaved as if nothing had happened.
But I think his enthusiasm suggests something to the contrary.
However, Mr. Putin's continued coldness in his attitude showed that he had not forgotten anything.
Indeed, the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction was fierce.
Mr Putin attacked the incident with a heavy attack on the incident, accusing Ankara of Moscow behind his back.
Attacks from so-called friends are even more difficult to accept.
It is difficult and impossible for both parties to re-establish genuine trust.
Russian public opinion has also been reversed since November.
In several months, the government-controlled media carried out an alarming and full attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
Among these, the most serious of these are accusations from high-ranking officials that Mr. Erdoğan's family has profited from the illegal oil transactions in the Syrian-controlled Syrian region.
He has categorically denied that claim.
But the news from St Petersburg showed, however, that it was time to look forward.
After all, the meeting was premised on Putin's receipt of an apology by President Erdoğan, Turkey's president.
Russia can declare victory.
The benefits of the truce are obvious to Ankara.
First, Erdoğan narrowly escaped from power after the defeat of the coup last month, so he needs the support of all his friends.
The ongoing terrorist attacks have clearly hit him badly.
There are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have a strong impact on Turkey, particularly the ban on air charter services that can transport millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The figure has fallen by nearly 90%.
With the resumption of flights, Russian travel agencies and air charter companies are bound to breathe a sigh of relief.
They will usher in the end of the season in the Mediterranean.
National television even predicted this week that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall once the import of Turkish agricultural products is 重新.
"The tourists went and the tomatoes came back," said Vedemosti, a Moscow newspaper.
The visit also has additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is outraged by the weak response of the western world to takeover intentions.
In addition, Ankara is deeply dissatisfied with the slow progress in joining the EU negotiations and Putin's long-standing involvement, and Putin is keen to use political chill and weaken the relationship between Turkey and the West.
As a result of the defeat of the elected authorities after the failure of the coup d'état, Russian leaders will have to receive the extension of Ankara.
Note that this is a gift for Moscow, which has been deeply rooted in fear of regime change.
As a result, the meeting in this magnificent seaside palace led to two Russian and Turkish allies who had been rejected and abused by the Western world, and an analyst described it as a "incompatible alliance."
However, despite public reconciliation, significant differences remain between the parties.
Syria is one of the key factors in Syria: Moscow's recent role in Syria and the role of the Yankees, while Russia and Turkey support the opposing factions.
It could be foreseen that, after nearly three hours of preliminary talks, the two presidents said at a press conference that the subject had not yet been addressed.
The President of Turkey has deliberately avoided the issue of disagreement between the two sides, and Putin has stressed it.
There is no clear consensus between the parties on how to find common ground on the Syrian issue.
It is certainly a good thing that the leaders of the two countries will resume their dialogue once again, following months of open hostilities and major catastrophes caused by the downing of Russian warplanes by Turkey's North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve as a customer service away from Scotland
According to RBS's chief executive, the bank will be streamlined into a logistics sector.
RBS will no longer serve customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the Royal Bank of Scotland had been committed to its global ambitions.
But when he was on the verge of collapse eight years ago, it had been forced to accept help from then on in order to abandon the pursuit.
At that time, brand strategist uses RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
The group has spent millions of pounds to sponsor the international sporting events, such as Andy Murray, the champion of the Rugby six and Wimbledon Tennis Championships.
But now, the right thing is to make more national brands figure.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used as a Scottish client but does not return it.
In England and Wales, all references to headquarters and stock exchanges would be changed to the National Westminster Bank.
The brand has been used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Autonomous Region.
There are also other more prominent private banking brands, such as the bank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt 's MilitaryBank.
Mr McGregor was interviewed in an interview with his staff at Frans County.
"The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand, and it is one of the employees' employment brands," he told the BBC.
RBS has also become a global brand since the bank itself became an international brand.
At the moment, I would like to say that we are no longer focused on the world, and we have turned our eyes to the mainland.
Each brand represents the difference in their respective industries, and our employees are customer service through different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has shown that it will not continue to sponsor the six-nation tournament; at the same time, efforts have been made to upgrade the image of different brands at sporting events.
"Now is the time to become a multi-brand bank because in private we have been looking for ways to be a better bank for our customers, "the chief executive said.
If we were determined to be a big bank with many brands three years ago, we would be ridiculed.
We are now focusing on client needs, and I am confident that you have noticed these changes.
I think we can restart these brands, and it's right now.
Dettori made 3,000
Newcastle's two triumphs to win more than 3,000 jobs, and then he sprayed champagne to celebrate
FrankieDettori, a career horse jockey, won his third thousand victories on Friday, New Jersey.
He pushed Predilettes, who came from the hands of Martin Gosden, to get two victories on the way that night, with a chance of winning more than 3,000 jobs.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth-bit career horse jockey who has made this milestone in the field of the flat race.
The top five are, Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Doug Smith, Berger (Lester Piggott), Mr. Weiss (Patty Piggott) and Williamson Carson.
"This is very special," he said at the three championships in Ghayyar who had won three championships earlier in Ghayyar.
I'm excited because my family is on the scene
I am pleased with my achievements in Newfoundland, since I started from here 30 years ago.
It's not a big Jockey Club, it's not the Royal Ascot, it's just a normal Friday night with a 20,000 audience.
I am glad and humble.
After winning the victory, Daisy came to Predilocks, causing the entire field to cheer
In the area of obstacles, two jockeys have achieved this achievement, namely, champion jockey Richard Johnson (Richard Johnson) and Sir McCoy, who is now retired, who won more than 4,300 victories in his record career.
Bergman was the winner of the nine-German competition, winning 4,493 victories in his career
He is one of the best jockeys in modern times, so it is not surprising that he has achieved this milestone, and there are not many people who have achieved it before.
He was fashionable and robust, but he really made him stand out in the weighing room but his tactical reason.
He was a great equestrian ambassador, and for years his enthusiasm and charm attracted a great deal of fans for the campaign.
A few weeks ago, in Epsom, I said that if he wasn't just a weekend with the contest, he should have won 6,000 victories!
It's too important to tell the truth, Mr. Dai is the best equestrian winner in the UK for thirty years.
He has a lively personality, which is a good thing for British horse racing, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Dali celebrates the milestone with its iconic jumping-off horse movement
From jumping to jump dismount, Dettori has been a typical representative of the British field in the past two decades.
His career is like a roller coaster.
He was the champion of many competitions, including a famous "seven-win" victory in 1996 in the British Crown Club, but he had also suffered the crash and had been banned for taking anti-drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned to the court three years later, he was struggling, but he showed an amazing personality and finally got back to the summit, giving them a great deal of skepticism.
He might not be able to do too long - he had said before he wanted to be at least 50 years old.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's dismissal of the post of Director of the General Office of Sergei Ivanov
Vladimir Putin (Vladimir Putin), President of Russia, unexpectedly lifted the post of President Sergei Ivanov's Office of the President of the Office of the President.
Over the years, Mr. Ivanov has been a molecule of the core group that Mr Putin has trusted.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, has now been appointed special representative on environment and transportation.
A statement by the Kremlin says Mr. Putin has "announced the release of the director of the Russian President's Office of the President of Russia," but there is no reason for it.
Anton Vaino, the deputy of Mr. Ivanov's deputy, had been appointed as his successor in 2012.
Mr. Vavino, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, Estonia, in 1972 and graduated from the famous Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo embassy.
Later, he managed the draft presidential and government employees, said the Kremlin's website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Mr. Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task for the government is to support the heads of state in drafting laws and control orders.
Mr. Putin told Russian television Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself had asked for his resignation and recommended Mr. Viniano to take over himself.
Is such a smile convincing?
Moscow is puzzled about the move.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Putin's closest aides, like Putin, and worked in the Soviet Security Agency (KGB).
As Chef de Cabinet, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
On a meeting with President Putin at the national television station, two per capita said the Chef de Cabinet himself called for his resignation.
Despite all the smiles in front of the camera, few people were convinced – especially before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this the result of the defeat in some power struggle?
It is not yet known.
But the official argument - a candidate who had been considered a presidential candidate suddenly chose to dominate Russia's environmental policy - drew a lot of doubt.
I quote Mr. Ivanov's dialogue with Mr. Putin on the Kremlin's website, he said, "Yes, early in 2012, I asked you to give me this difficult position in a dialogue, or even a troublesome position for four years."
"as a result, I have been the President of the Office of the President for four years and eight months."
Mr. Ivanov assumed the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as deputy prime minister and minister of defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Mr. Putin, is also a former member of the National Security Agency.
Mr. Ivanov was appointed as his deputy at the end of the 1990 "s when Mr Putin became the director of the Federal Security Agency (FSB, formerly the head of the National Security Service).
After Mr. Putin came into power, Mr. Putin appointed Mr. Ivanov as one of his most trusted five people.
It was once considered that Mr. Ivanov might be a Russian president after Mr. Putin's second term of office, since the third term was unconstitutional.
But the position eventually belongs to Vladimir Putin, another close associate of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin served as Prime Minister of Russia until after three and a half years of re-election.
The mysterious fish startled Banff a garden
A residents of Banff found a fish in his garden and then asked for help.
Kevin Bain believes the 75 fish may have been seared by sea tornadoes.
Mr. Bain, who lived about 500 metres from the sea, posted a video on the strange scene on Periscope, hoping someone could explain why these two inches of fish would appear.
The Kunstfelly Bridge is now available in Fife
The project, which costs £1.35 billion, is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have joined the bridge over the North Bridge and Takahashi Bridge in the Quinn bridge, that is, the bridge is now reached Faw.
The "bridge fan" close to each of the three bridges in each bridge is now nearing completion, and the project is headed by a dragon bridge.
The bridge started at 600 metres long and weighed 30, 000 metric tons.
It used 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 oblique cables.
The project of Pound13.5 billion was planned to be completed in May 2017.
The Minister of Economics, Keith Brown, visited the scene today and became one of the first people to climb the bridge.
"This is a historic moment in the construction of the Cube River Bridge," he said.
We all witnessed engineering operations on such an ambitious project, which used more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel for the construction of the bridge.
Although the size and weight of the bridge are enormous, the completion of the bridge between the viaduct and the deck requires fine work, requiring very precise assembly.
Overall, nearly 79 per cent of the total bridge has now been installed, and the concrete bridge deck of the last paragraph is today in Rosyth, which means that all the bridges are ready in place.
"No matter which bridge project, the first time the dragon is a major milestone," said Michael Martin, director of the company project at the Cuisbury Bridge.
In the case of this remarkable project, the dragon shows the advanced civil engineering technique.
The remaining gap between the north side or near the land side is needed next to the installation of the last leg panel and connecting it to the expanded North Bridge road panel.
The completion of the operation required the transfer of 700 millimetres from the north tower to the south.
This is a huge operation, and it is also a very sophisticated operation.
It is huge because the height of the bridge is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 metric tons, requiring a set of about 3% of the slope.
It is sophisticated because the engineering team needs to ensure that the deviation is very small, each side only a few millimeters.
It is gratifying to note that everything has progressed well.
Simon Beers won the Women's Gymnastics World Championships
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles, Simone Biles, is not immune to all this.
The horse is full of vitality.
There is more than a balance on the balance.
The motion of the free gymnastics is amazing.
The whole performance was excellent.
Now, finally, it became the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast picked up the Almighty champion and showed her talent for a leading world in gymnastics at the Olympic Games.
She has a silver medalist in 62.198, the "ultimate five-person group" (AlyRaisman) and the bronze medalist Russian player Muya Mustafina.
Simon-Beers from the United States staged a balance-and-off performance on the gymnastics of the gymnastics women's solo final at the 2016 Summer Olympics, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Beers helped the U.S. team to achieve four crowns on the gymnastics of the Olympic women's gymnastics, and she had won five medals at the Games, further confirming that she was the generation and probably the best gymnast ever.
At the moment when he saw her own score, Beers couldn't help shed tears. She finally finished the long journey.
Beers were among the ranks of Michael Phelps, who ranked sports in their respective fields to a new height, as Michael Phelps said.
"Beers were the best gymnast I've ever seen," says Mary Louretton, the best gymnast I've ever seen, "says Mary Louretton, the Olympic champion, who has been playing tennis in the last three years.
There is a final game in Brazil, but the game is more a match between her own and the pressure of great expectations than the competition of the other gymnasts.
If Beers did not return a gold medal to her home in Springer, Texas, everyone would be disappointed.
Simon Beers (left) from the United States and Les Mann hugged each other, and they won gold and silver in the finals of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August.
The Bears won their first gold medal on Tuesday with a surprise victory for retiring national coach Martha Karolyi.
Although Beers insisted that he did not plan for the future in the process of holding a championship on a perennial basis, the fact was not exactly the case.
The part of Beers's freestyle gymnastics, including her iconic twist, was the Latin music, which she often listened to at the house of the Rio Olympic venue only one street.
That is no coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents at the time of the baby and found by the mother of the trainer Aimee Boorman during a field trip to the gym, has grown into a leading force.
Since the summer of 2013, Beers had not lost his hand in all-round matches, and she would win if he wanted to win.
It was just an illusion that Mustadena had a little lead after two spin.
The balance beam was caught up with the defending world champion of the floor of the floor exercise.
She scored 15.433 in balance and 15.933.
When he was waiting for the final score, Lehrman gave him a gentle hug. When Beers learned about what he had dreamed of, he left tears.
Pehrman's performance was somewhat like revenge for four years ago, when she justed third, but lost to Mustadena in the final victory.
But this time, the American comedian called the 22-year-old captain of "Granny."
She gave a kiss to the crowd after the end of the floor exercise, but the return had sometimes seemed to be in doubt.
Beers were 19 years old. From earlier this week, the news spread out of the virus, and the life of Beers was entirely new.
Six-year-old MahajBrown, six-year-old MahajBrown, escaped from the Philadelphia shootings
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the six-year-old boy in the city this week.
The child's grandparents confirmed to CBSA that the shot was Mahamj Brown.
They said Brown's groin, legs, arms and abdomen had multiple gunshot wounds, but the child was sober on his way to the doctor.
"he was guilty of a lot of guilt, and the little body was hit by bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the TV station.
I can't believe it.
The boy was in a critical condition in the hospital and had undergone numerous surgeries.
His family told the TV station that the child was expected to recover.
He was supposed to start the first grade in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of the four men who had been shot in the German town of Germantown.
Two of the three men who were shot were 29 years old and a 32-year-old.
According to CBSA, one of the 29-year-old victims was critical; the other two were stable.
The TV station said the child was found on the front seat of the car with the 29-year-old victim.
The two other victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether there were gunmen in the injured person.
The investigators told CBSnake that it looked like several gunshots were caught in the crossfire.
At the scene, a number of offensive weapons were found on the site, which could be inferred that they were using different offensive weapons.
This leads to judgment that this is undoubtedly a continuing battle.
There were shells on both sides of the street on both sides of the street.
"so, there were many armed men in the scene at the time," said the police director of Philadelphia, Anthony Ginaldi, to the television station.
There are many houses and vehicles damaged in the area.
The arrests have not yet been carried out, and the police are said to be watching video surveillance cameras.
On Tuesday, a six-year-old child (girl) was shot by a stream while playing at the door of the West Oak Lane community.
She is now recovering, and the police are still pursuing suspects.
Why do we need Simon, Gabrielle and Lorry
That's how I evaluated this year's women's Olympic Gymnastics team for more than one reason.
First of all, since 1984, I went to the Summer Olympics every summer, but the United States never did so.
Second, the team has three good gymnasts -- Simon Biles, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Laura Hernández (Laurence Laurie Hernandez) who have been motivating many of the coloured girls.
The composition of this team is of great pride to all, since it contains the Jewish Ariel Sharon (AlyRaisman) and the Catholic Madison Section (Madison Kosmos).
The team finally looked like the United States.
It also solidified black and Latino women at the top of the campaign.
In the past four years, the first female gymnast has been a non-American gymnast.
Last year Simon and Gabriele broke the first and second place.
It's too bad.
The last Olympics, Gabrielle Douglas, became the Olympic champion unexpectedly, which cheered the United States.
Today, the world is able to witness the brilliant performance of the three world champions Simon Biles, Douglas and laurie Hernández.
On Thursday, Simon helped the U.S. team to a four-point win over the women's individual all-rounder.
Her teammate Ali Lehrman won the silver medal.
We climbed the top of the sport, but this was not the case in the national gymnastics class.
Simon, Gabrielle and Lorry entered the Olympic team, just like Ali and Madison.
They are the ultimate five group, because the next Olympic gymnastics team will be composed of four gymnastics, which is the last year of pre-service.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a costly exercise, and gymnasts are trained mainly in private gymnastics clubs, whose parents need to pay training, facilities, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (including costs for coaches and gymnasts and family members) and the cost list is increasing.
The majority of the gymnastics clubs are located in the affluent suburbs that provide support for the industry.
All the training of the gymnast is completed in these clubs and is a long-term expensive expense for the gymnast's family.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Beers, and coach Maggie Haney of Elsoud coach Maggie Haney have been teaching them since the gymnast began to exercise gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable, more accessible gymnastics training to young girls who are deeply affected by Simon, Gabrielle and Lorry.
Twenty years ago, I set up my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we offer free, cheap gymnastics to over 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Hispanic Americans) in black residential areas, and train national and even world champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to those young people who deserve this learning and will benefit from this remarkable Olympic movement.
Gymnastics helps to cultivate the strength, flexibility and coordination of body, and also helps to cultivate the spirit, self-discipline and determination of hard work.
These can provide lifelong benefits for a person's health, education and success.
Inspired by this team, thousands of young girls will study gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in the campaign is significant, especially for girls.
This is an exciting moment.
Thanks to Simon, Ali, Lorry, Gabrielle and Madison, thanks to the "Girls Power," which they have shown in winning the gold medals at the Olympic team, and thank them for inspiring so many young girls to open the road to health, power and success.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunter's proposal, the primary doctor plans to launch a further strike
The Ministers initially hoped to put an end to the change-triggered dispute by accepting the amended contract by the British Medical Association (BMA) officials, with 58 per cent against the contract among the 37,000 primary doctors who participated in the vote.
In July, Mr. Hunt disclosed plans to enforce the contract, saying that the NHS is currently in a "vacuum zone" and that a slight delay would compromise the interests of employees and patients.
The new contract, first of all, refers to the revision of the practice of primary doctors to work all night and weekend work to improve the care of irregular working hours.
Last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Primary School of Medicine, said in a statement that "primary doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially if it exacerbates the current labour crisis and fails to treat all doctors fairly."
There is only eight weeks left for the first doctors to sign a new contract, and we need to make progress.
BMA tried to settle the dispute through negotiations, but everyone was reluctant to participate, and sometimes the government was silent.
Nevertheless, last month we managed to get the promise of Jeremy Hunt, who said his door remained open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to take action now, cancel enforcement and address the concerns of primary doctors.
If he did not do so, the primary doctor made it clear that they were ready to take further labour action.
The last strike, which occurred at the end of April, led to approximately 13,000 operations and an appointment for an appointment to be postponed because nurses and the doctors used cover for doctors on the picket line.
Ministers initially hoped to put an end to this change-induced dispute by accepting BMA's revised contract.
BMA hopes for a better weekend wage for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHSEMatters, called on the primary doctor not to put on any strike again.
Mr. Mortimer said: "There is little effect on labour action, but on the contrary, it puts pressure on the already exhausted teams and services, leading to anxiety, anxiety and confusion among patients, caregivers and their families."
In the past two months, we have been engaged in negotiations with the Primary Health Practitioners Board and, together with the Ministry of Health and other departments, has actively responded to their concerns about the role of guardians and the reporting of whistle-blowers.
Employers are expected to continue to actively explore other important topics, such as deployment, training flexibility, co-cognition, training costs for those who interrupt their careers, co-cognition, refresher leave and gender pay differentials in the syllabus, which illustrate the importance attached by employers, the Health Education Unit and the Ministry of Health to the agreement reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A pound of 2 pounds a day can reduce the threat of heart attack
The officials suggested the extension of a drug of 2 pounds a day to more patients and the extension of medication time, and thousands of patients with heart disease would benefit from such drugs.
Anticoagulant drugs can reduce the risk of heart disease in patients with heart disease.
This drug continues to take 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or heart attack.
The National Health and Clinical Optimization Research Institute (NICE), a supervisory body under the NHS, advises patients to continue taking pills for a period of four years in order to further reduce the risk of heart-vascular disease.
But now NHS regulators NICE advises patients to continue taking pills for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of heart-vascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease every year, with a quarter of them going to suffer from a heart attack or a stroke.
The heart attack and stroke are caused by the formation of a plaque in the arteries of the arteries.
If the plaque breaks down, it causes blood clots, which impede the flow of blood to the heart, leading to heart attacks.
If the thrombus moves, it will enter the bloodstream, preventing blood flowing into the brain, leading to a stroke.
Patients who have experienced a heart attack have a higher risk of a heart attack.
替 is manufactured by British AstraZeneca, a British company, for sale in Brilique (Brilique), which can reduce the risk of morbidity by reducing the formation of thrombosis.
The draft NICE guidelines issued today recommended that patients take 90 mg of paternity leave for 12 months, after three years of taking a 60-mg substitute card and two aspirin.
"in spite of effective secondary prevention, as many as a quarter of those who have a heart disease can again or stroke again, often with serious consequences," said Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre.
The fear of recurrence would have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
The evidence suggests that taking aspirin with aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke in patients who experience heart attacks.
We are greatly encouraged by the temporary referral of the bench Grey's interim recommendation to provide more treatment options for thousands of people who have benefited from it.
Owing to the limited information on the efficacy and safety of the bench in three years, particularly the risk of haemorrhage, the draft guidance does not recommend that it continue to be treated after this period.
Computer culture makes "electoral fraud" in the Muslim area
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Rahman (Lutz Rahman), who had been reclassified last year by corruption, led to the publication of a government report.
The culture of "political correctness " caused widespread electoral fraud in the Muslim community to be ignored, as the deadly government report reveals today.
Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet minister, accused the police, the regulatory agencies and the city hall of turning a blind eye to the evidence of the misuse of the elections because of "excessive sensitivity to ethnic divisions and religious issues."
The former Minister of Community Affairs, the current anti-corruption minister, said the practice of intimidating voters with religious positions was bad, and the police should be allowed to set up a cordon outside the polling stations to protect the frightened voters.
He suggested that voters should be allowed to carry identity documents when they voted to confirm their identity.
At present, voters are required to give only their own names and addresses.
The report even suggested adding ink to the voters' finger to prevent a second vote.
Sir Eric said the protection of whistle-blowers should be stepped up.
He called for increased media awareness of parliamentary documentation and the means of decisions taken by the unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not just to guard against election fraud or to protect local governments from a widespread culture of corruption and the poison of financial fraud associated with them," he said.
The report was issued in Downing Street after the Tower Hamlet election scandal took place in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that there was a chain of corruption and illegal acts on the part of the responsible mayor, who should be dismissed.
The court found that Rahman was "very funny" to abuse the religious feelings of the Muslim community and shut down accusations of racial discrimination and Islamophobia.
Said was said to have claimed to vote for him as a religious duty of a loyal Muslim during his campaign.
As many as 300 votes are suspected, voters may vote for voters.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of electoral fraud across the country.
He warned, in particular, of the fraudulent use of electoral fraud and said that senior members of the Muslim community were said to exert pressure on voters, forcing them to vote for the candidate they had appointed.
Sir Eric (in photos) gave a number of suggestions on the clearing-house mechanism, including a good identification document to confirm his identity
He reported in the report that "evidence shows that senior members, especially women and young people in a number of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people in the context of the background community in Pakistan and Bangladesh, have put pressure on them to vote in accordance with their will."
"Due to the excessive sensitivity of ethnic divisions and religious" political correctness, "they fear that State institutions will turn a blind eye to such acts."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the electoral mechanism, including by strictly prohibiting political activists from handling mail voting documents to prevent "voting gains."
The report also requires strictly to register information to prevent the electoral roll from being used for immigration and welfare fraud.
The recommendations included the requirement for voters to present their identity documents before the vote.
After the vote, there is no ink on the finger of the voter's finger to prevent a second vote.
The systematic verification of the national ownership of the electorate in order to ensure eligibility for voting.
The period of validity of the automatic mailing request shall be fixed for a period of three years.
Political activists and activists are prohibited from disposing of completed mail and mail ballot envelopes.
The police are authorized to set up police cordon around the polling stations.
The amendment of the legal provisions made it easier to prosecute the persons concerned in accordance with the People's Deputies Act 1983 (Representation of the People Act1983).
It is illegal to provide for photographs at the polling stations.
The provision is made for the use of English only in the polling stations (except in Wales).
(D) Strengthen training to ensure that staff members strictly enforce the provisions of the "stand-alone vote of voters."
Sir Eric denounced the Metropolitan Police (Metropolitan Police) who said they were "surprised" that they did not file any criminal charges after the Tower Hamlet incident.
"There have been a number of corruption and violations committed by the" Rahman and his Electoral Officers and, as a result, the disqualification of the Electoral Tribunal has been met, "he said.
In many respects, he is guilty of guilt in many respects, in accordance with the standard of criminal proof.
He also criticized the "checkbox check" of the town hall election registration department.
"Last year, the court heard a wake-up call to all of you, "said Sir Eric.
My country has a glorious tradition of "the mother of parliament," but it is a matter of concern that some institutions privately-secretive electoral fraud and ex post facto grievances pose a cause for concern and a good reputation.

On Wednesday, Byron MacDonald, the fourth-year-old comments on the 14-year-old Liberal Women's 4x200m freestyle relay race, angered viewers watching the live broadcast of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)
CBC was forced to apologize for a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, who said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer would "travel faster than stink" in the race, and then CBC was forced to apologize.
At the end of the Women's 4x200m freestyle relay race at the Women's 4x200m freestyle, demographer Byron McDonald made some of his own ideas, when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
"The 14-year-old Chinese girl has made a stupid mistake," said Byron, who was the 14-year-old Chinese girl, who heard the CBC narrator team.
It was too excited to start to swim faster than smelly, but later as a pig.
Well, thanks to her, too.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Zhaoxing is the second best, 57 seconds when it comes to 1861 seconds behind Canada's Taylor Ruck (Taylor Ruck) and then the Canadian team has narrowed the gap with China.
The whole Canadian audience was shocked by the demographer's tone and wording, and then they quickly responded to the network
"The CBC commentator said the 14-year-old swimmer" slowed like a pig, "says Emmy Macfarlane, a 14-year-old swimmer.
The idiot didn't realize it was on live.
"China's 14-year-old Chinese girl has made a stupid mistake," said China, a 14-year-old Chinese girl, who took part in the Women's 4x200m freestyle relay race.
The criticism of Byron McDonald on Twitter quickly spread on Twitter, with many asking for its exit from the commentary.
When Twitter users heard that Byron MacDonald was slow, they did not stop.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, writes: "Wow. Byron McDonald.
What you're talking about CBC and Canada, your words and words make us all listen to a group of racists. # 8943; # 8943; # 8943; # 8943; # 8943; # 8943; # 8943; # 8943; # 8943; # 8943; # 8943; # 8943; # 8943; # 8943; # 8943; # 8943; # 8943; # 8943; # 8943; # 8943
Shortly after that, Scott Russel, the CBC broadcaster, apologized for Byron's speech, saying, "We apologise for the comments of the live swimmers."
"We are sorry to have this inappropriate wording."
CBC apologized for more than 90 per cent of Twitter users who responded to the statement
Another commentator Scott Russel also apologized on behalf of Byron
CBC, after CBC, copied their apology to more than 90 Twitter users who protested to Byron
The channel also soon apologized and issued a statement.
We are terribly sorry about saying that and we're going to live on live.
Last night, we acted quickly to apologize to the viewers who watched us live, as well as to our audience on social media.
It was to be noted that Byron's explanation was directed at the performance of the swimmer, but was not directed against her personally.
That is, Byron is deeply sorry that the wording is indeed inappropriate.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologised in the live broadcast, saying his words had not meant a half-point attack, and tried to justify his remarks.
"I want to spend some time apologizing for my remarks last night at the end of the womens relay race," he said in the CBC Olympics.
"I'm just going to comment on the performance of the swimmer, not the individual."
"Of course, I don't mean, I'm sorry."
The Primark customer was angry with a woman who was brazen in his underwear at the store
A woman in a Primark shop in the middle of a Primark shop tried panties, and the store customers don't know where to look.
Worse still, she looked at how she looked after, and then took her underwear off and put back on the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelves and eventually tried four panties in the store at the Bouveriana Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The woman tried to wear underwear in the Primark store in Folkestone's Bouveriana Place shopping mall, and then returned to the shelf
Jenny Davidson (mother of two children), who was also at the store, said, after wearing underwear, the mysterious woman was "re-dressed" and went out of the shop and didn't buy anything.
"Everyone can't believe what I see," she said.
She just stood in the middle of the store, got a pair of underwear off the shelves, took off her leggings and underwear, and put it on.
She didn't try to find the hidden place to try it - she was just standing there, so brazen.
"When she dropped her underwear again, everyone was stunned, apparently not satisfied, because she put her underwear back on the shelf."
Then she tried three, and finally found none of them liked, and then dressed in good clothes and went out of the shop.
'she didn't seem to care if someone was looking at her - or did not think about who was going to end up buying her tried-through knickers. '
Ms. Davidson (33 years old), who lives in Kent town, said: "I think it's disgusting to think that someone will buy an underwear that goes through and has not been cleaned."
This happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. son added: "When she left, the clerk clearly had to take these underwear off the shelves, but fortunately it was.
"I hate buying a new panties, but I found another woman tried to go through and never cleaned it."
"Primark already knows what happened in our Folkestone store on August 9," a spokesman for Primark said.
All the problems in question have been laid down.
How to Protect Yourself in a gun attack using gamma gamma
The world is dangerous, but the video on the Daily Mail may give you a sense of security.
We consulted the Mahatra Mizrachi of the Mahatma Federation in New York on how to deal with the perpetrators of the gun at close range.
Whether he is from the front or behind you, the video will teach you how to lose.
Mizrachi says if the gunman is coming closer to you, the first thing you want to do is turn around so that you can see the attackers and "clean the line."
Then, hold the gun with your forearm and shoulder, and then hit the attacker with your elbow.
Then he left the groin with his knee on the top of his knee, twisting his gun in his hands when the attackers bent down and beat his face with a barrel and a reserve gun and kept the weapon on him.
If the gunman moves from the front, a similar trick is used to get your body away from the fire line, seize the gun and turn the gun at gunpoint, so that the gunman can't fire.
At the same time, the weight must be weighed on the gun and struck the attacker's chest, and turned the gun from his grip and pointed at him at gunpoint.
That sounds very complicated?
Look at the video and see what the Mizrachi did.
But remember, if you're not a master of Gamma, you want to get rid of the robbery, the safest way to hand over cash.
A family of hooligans destroyed a low-rent house in Soyshire, Cornwall, before being expelled
A family of hooligans who had been evicted as a result of intimidation of their neighbours had caused damage to their rented premises prior to their departure, resulting in a loss of £50,000.
After a long list of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and his husband, Shaun Trebilcock, were driven out of low-cost rental accommodation in Sota County, Cornwall.
After being forcibly removed from the shelter, the Housing Society official was surprised to find it seriously damaged.
There was a hole in the wall, and the floor was torn, and the rubbish was strewn with the rubbish.
After being expelled, the family has been moving and is said to live in private homes
'she's worried that the house has not been saved, 'says Donna McEvil, Housing Manager, Cornwall Housing Society.
"It's a nightmare for people living here," she said. "I don't think people can live like this."
Now there are a lot of things to weigh because the house is likely to be a very good element in Cornwall.
The family is notorious and their names are equally notorious.
The couple have three sons, who live here from time to time. Police said the terrorist acts included the use of baseball bats to fight, terrorize nearby residents, drug addiction, drug trafficking, yelling, quarrels and cursing.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant named Skeldon had received a resolution on anti-social behaviour.
In the house where the house is likely to be demolished, many rooms have been placed in a long time
The floor was raised in the room where the drug had been traded
The neighbors said they often saw them fighting in the streets, and often called the police
After giving the 11-week extension to allow them to move voluntarily, the Cornwall Housing Society forcibly removed her husband from her husband this week.
The neighbors, who were finally relieved, cheered and said that their previous life was simply a hell of a hell.
"They don't care about anyone," said one of the neighbors.
We've been living next door for 20 years. It's been so bad.
We had seen the police on numerous occasions.
"We can't sleep this morning."
We got up early, because it's so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It was very kind of them to get away at last.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a community executive director at Cornwall's Housing Society, said the family had not been able to cooperate with the local government.
The family lived in the house for 20 years and the police regularly visited
The rubbish and old toys were thrown away on the side of the cheap apartment
He added: "It is regrettable that the tenant did not have any responsibility for her behaviour with her family, and that the expulsion was the final consideration of the Cornwall Housing Association."
This is a very difficult case, because their behaviour is extremely extreme, and their actions must be extremely frightened by their neighbours.
I thank my team for the work done, and I would like to thank the police and the members of the community who were brave enough to provide us with information.
I hope this will bring some comfort to the neighbors and convey such a message that we do not tolerate any act of antisocial behaviour.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said their three sons had lived in the house in different times, but also said they were in their 20s.
After they were removed, a dirty mattress was thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms
The workers of the Housing Society will soon clean up piles of rubbish around the house
In 2014, the house had been searched by the police, and 70 dock cannabis was found and $700 in cash was found.
After having pleaded guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of B drugs and drug trafficking.
She claim. that the money was used to buy a tombstone for her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is understood that, after homelessness, Tanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth.
Graffiti was painted on the walls of the room.
Police said they will expel tenants who defy tenant rules.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall County police said the eviction gave a clear warning to other tenants who continue to disobey the tenant rules.
"This warning is directed against those who believe that their actions will not be blamed, and those who are abused by such acts," she said.
Devon and Cornwall Police Department will never tolerate crime and anti-social behavior, and they will continue to work together to protect our communities.
Reed: Hillary Clinton, if elected president, will nominate Garland to the Supreme Court
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said he was confident that if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was elected president, she would nominate Garland Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have been stopping the confirmation of Garland since Barack Obama's President, Barack Obama, nominated Garland in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would select the person to replace the late Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
On Thursday's conference on Thursday, Reed said he predicted Hillary Clinton would choose to "have some credibility" Garland.
A spokeswoman for Reed said that Reed did not nominate Garland to talk directly with Hillary Clinton and said he was just guessing.
He praised Garland and said that Hillary's team did not want to be "spoiler" for the new candidate.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the Federal Circuit Court of Columbia, United States of America.
The Republicans who stopped Garland's nomination were Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump's "Favorite" and "achievers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He says Trump is not fit for the president.

The French Court rejected the petition to dismantle the shops in the jungle camp
A French court rejected the petition by the Gale Government to dismantle dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the "jungle" camps, where thousands of refugees are currently living in the refugee camps.
At the court's hearing this week, the court held that the French government should have the right to dismantle a total of 72 makeshift shops in the camp, selling goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, providing haircuts, and selling tea at 50 cents (40 pence) in makeshift restaurants or selling basic meals at a price of several euros.
The Governor's office is of the view that these places should be demolished, as they are parallel economies that do not pay taxes, but also fire and health hazards.
The humanitarian community, however, expressed the utmost importance to the Court that these shops and restaurants were essential, as free food provided by State-supported associations and other groups could not meet the needs of the growing number of refugees in the camp.
They say these makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for people in need.
One court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the operators of the 72 temporary shops, but said the Governor's concern was "fully understandable."
According to Judge Jean François Molla, the role of these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants is much more than simply providing food to refugees living under extremely dangerous conditions.
These places, he said, were a calm convergence between refugees and volunteers.
One of the demolitions threatened was the "Jungle Bookstore" cafe in the refugee camp, which provides 200 food, English and French lessons per day, and provides shelter for hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the refugee camp.
Over 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, the Guardian wrote that closing the coffee shop would be a catastrophe for these children, many children, eight years old.
The two philanthropic organizations of the Help Refugees and L'Aubergedes Migrants forecast Friday that the number of refugees in the jungle camps has exceeded 9,000, which is also the highest ever since the surge in the number of refugees in the summer.

That is to say, by means of legal means to crack down on environmental violations, severely punish the excessive discharge of enterprises, protect the environment and safeguard public health.

Emissions are also known as "emission rights," which is the right to discharge pollutants, the right of the emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment within the amount allocated by the government.
This right is, in essence, the right to the possession, use and proceeds of the resources of environmental capacity.
The next step is to transfer the amount of water between the sources of pollutants through the exchange of money between the sources of pollutants without exceeding the allowable emissions.
The trading of pollutant emissions trading began in the 1970s by the US economist Dale, in 1968, and the US began to apply it to atmospheric and river pollution sources in the 1970 "s.

With the popularity of smartphones, mobile phones are becoming more fun, with micro-mail, microblogging, even playing games, shopping for freebies, and many people seem to have no need of mobile phones, even when driving.
The Road Traffic Safety Act explicitly prohibits the driving of mobile phones and defines it as "obstructing safe driving."
Unfortunately, it is regrettable that this phenomenon has not been adequately punished for reasons such as offenders and witnesses, and that the provisions of the law are almost furnished.
If the delivery authorities are determined to "declare war" on the drive to play mobile phones, this measure will be normalized, which must be curbed.

Xiamen girl Zhang Bingley: "Handsomely" begins to shoot a few "reversals" of the course of shooting
Zhang Dong Hongyuan in the village of Chang'an District of Xiamen is just 29 inches of old TV set at home for a few days and replaced 65-inch TV.
The ordinary farmer's daughter, in the evening of 11, won the silver medal of the 50-meter finals of the Women's 50m Rifle in China.
The day and night, before the new TV, Zhang Dong-red couple and dozens of relatives, together to witness her daughter's journey, have been eliminated from almost pre-finals to the magic process that almost reversed.
In the game on the same day, Mr. Bingley was in the middle of the rankings and seemed to be far away from the final.
But parents and close friends did not give up, brush their text live, and saw that as the other runners finished, Mr. Zhang promoted the finals and eventually locked the final seat, while his family suddenly erupted from a burst of applause.
In the final, Zhang Bingley was in the final position, the more steady the last number of shots, the more steady the last few shots, won the silver medal in the only 0.2-ring champion.
Mr Bingley, a 27-year-old Mr. Bingley, has nearly nearly crossed this hard-won silver medal in a 16-year shooting career.
Zhang Xiaodong told reporters that when they hesitated, Mr. Bingley was looking for a few "novels" in the same village.
These "novels" were the same village children who were also recommended to participate in intensive training in the same year, and Zhang Bingley's cousin.
Shortly after entering the Xiamen team, he once again returned to the school of XiangAn for reasons such as family difficulties and so on.
But Mr. Zhang returned to Xiamen after the repeated work of his enlightenment coach Zhang Yadja.
After entering the provincial team, Zhang Binbin was back home because he couldn't get into the national team for a while because he couldn't see the hope.
This time, not only coach Zhang Yjie, Xiamen shooting archery movement center and Fujian province team leaders and coaches all came to the home, finally persuaded Zhang Zang to return to the provincial team.
As it was yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl insisted on the reversal of the road to the shooting.
"Each coach chooses the team's methods differently, when I saw Bingley's very beautiful hand, and I was in a hurry."
Zhang Dong-hong also recalls that in the training tests, the daughter is not at his best, but the ring number is stable, which is an important reason to attract a coach.
Zhang Yadja was the most impressed by the training of Mr Bingley, and was the input of the peasant girl.
He recalled that Mr. Bingley had entered the Xiamen firing squad for more than a year, and the team carried out a long-shot training in the team and asked for half an hour to move.
Zhang Xiaodong told reporters that her daughter had been a quiet child, like painting and homemade hand-made toys from a young age.
"I would have made some clothes and stitches at home, and Bingley will pick up some corners of his own doll."
She said her daughter often made her hand-made toys, plus she was good at drawing, from the doll's five officers to the dress, and always made lifelike.
As an athlete, Zhang Bingley and his family gather little, only holidays can go home, usually do more by telephone.
Parents say, whether they meet or call, Mr. Bingley rarely speaks of his hard work, much more than talking to his parents.
She never met her daughter in peacetime, and her parents kept their daughter in the house as a child, as well as the honour of the calendar year.
Zhang Xiaodong presented her daughter's cartoon to the reporter, "If there is no shooting athlete, she should continue to paint."
In the drawing-room on the second floor of Bingley, there was a cabinet filled with medals, medals and certificates.
Zhang Dong Honghong will put the medals and medals in order, and the certificate is unified in the folder, "These are the honor of Bingley for more than ten years, and we all cherish it."

The mainland diamond sales are now referred to as three major problems, including the up of the 虚标 diamond clarity, the weight of the diamond and the of after, according to Hong Kong's East Daily Daily.
Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centres, with diamond cutting technology in local artisans, and diamonds sold are highly qualified and welcome by the Mainland.
"A small sack, held in the palm of the palm, a handful of light floating, worth nearly $10 million," a Liu's mother, who was involved in the purchase of diamonds, described her experience in Antwerp in June this year.
She said she hid the diamonds in her underwear, and she had a toilet and a shower on several days, and she was very nervous to go to bed.
The diamond bought in Antwerp, she said, was worth about $50,000 per carat, and the quality of diamonds in Xiamen was about 10, 000 yuan.
She had bought the purchase price by two years ago, sold all the purchased diamonds and earned $200,000 a year.

China's plan for Mars is here
The mission of our Mars exploration mission is to carry around, land, tour, and this form is never seen abroad.
Our mission to Mars exploration is to take a step around, to land, to patrol, and the task is quite difficult.
Because Mars exploration takes 26 months to reach a time window, experts are working closely to develop a plan to launch our first Mars Rover window in 2020.
According to Xu DZhe, although our aircraft has entered a deep space, the completion of the Mars exploration mission is still indispensable, and the detection of Mars means that China has entered a deep space exploration era in its real sense.
"once every two or three years, Mars has a recent opportunity to launch a Mars probe at this point in time, which is the most energy source for the launch vehicle."
"Taking into account the quality of the Mars probe, the launch mission will be completed by the Long March launch vehicle of our country."
My country's Mars exploration mission is going to be around, landing, touchy, and this form is never seen abroad, and abroad once it is to be surrounded and landed once, but the landing failed.
The technical area involved in Mars exploration is very much, and the feature is that although the spark vehicle is a space detector, it has distinct features compared to the general space detector.
In other words, the Mars Detector has the ability to identify routes and identify obstacles.
"The exploration of Mars is so popular because it has important science, technology, and even the future of mankind," said Pontig, a researcher at the five-yard research team of China's Space Science and Technology Group.
Now Mars has become the planet with the highest level of human research beyond Earth, and the history of human use of space detectors for Mars is almost across the entire human race.
So humanity hopes to build a residence base on Mars one day, eventually to migrate to Mars and turn it into the second home of humanity.
There are plenty of evidence that Mars is likely to be the same as the present planet, just after billions of years of evolution into thin, low-temperature, water-drying, and so on.
As a result, research on the exploration or manned landing of Mars can make a tentative plan to prevent the Earth from becoming a second planet in which human beings are difficult to survive.
As of June 2016, a total of 114 lunar exploration and 43 Mars surveys were conducted worldwide.
However, since the 1990 "s, humans have carried out 18 missions to Mars, compared to 14 in the lunar exploration.
There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars rover vehicles at work, but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are at work.
The world's space-faring nations have developed exploration plans aimed at the Mars system, so today's Mars exploration is hotter than lunar exploration.
On 5 November 2013, India launched the first Mars probe "Manga," which became the first Asian country to successfully detect Mars.
"Mangaran" is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral features of Mars and explore the presence of methane and life signs on Mars.
The hardest part of this task is that the probe into the atmosphere of the Mars atmosphere and parachute decelerate only once
The Mars exploration mission is facing many technical challenges, according to Sun Zang, the master designer of the five-yard Mars probe, the Chinese Academy of Aeronautics and Technology, China's Space Science and Technology Group.
The atmospheric pressure of Mars is low, and only 1% of the surface pressure of the Earth's surface has high uncertainty.
Scientists don't have a thorough understanding of the factors such as its changes and the characteristics of the storm.
In summer, Mars often produces dust storms similar to the dust of the earth, which will lead to a sharp drop in the sun's solar energy, which must be designed for Rover to wait patiently for the dust storm.
At the same time, the Mars atmosphere has a reduction in solar illumination, which poses a difficult problem for Mars's energy supply.
This requires the detector's solar wing to be larger, and it needs to be constantly adjusted, trying to target the sun.
Also, the surface of Mars is only 38% of the Earth, but more gravity than the surface of the moon, so the detector needs more power.
"The most central and difficult part of the Mars exploration mission is the process of detecting aerodynamic shapes and parachute decelerating after the probe enters the atmosphere of Mars, and only once a chance, must be sure to succeed."
Sun said the entire process could not be controlled by the ground because the Earth was remote from Mars, so it was necessary to rely on the detector to complete it autonomously.
Because there was not so much propellant to offset that high speed, the deceleration would have to rely on the Martian atmosphere when landing on Mars, but the Martian atmosphere was difficult to simulate on the ground.
"In general, the way to probe Mars is similar to the way to detect the moon," he said. "It's the goal of manned landing on Mars," he said.
Because Mars is far from Earth than the moon is far from the moon, it takes a series of more complex technical hurdles to detect Mars.
According to Taiwan's media reports, the "executive director" Lin said yesterday morning that "the party and its accompanying organizations improperly obtained property treatment regulations" came into force today.
"One hundred years of the Kuomintang, the Kuomintang, with the commitment and responsibility of the community, will not fail," the deputy chairman of the Kuomintang said.
The Secretary-General emphasizes that, in the event of a prohibition of disposition imposed by a political party, a party attached to an organization or trustee, the Commission will investigate and punish, "according to law," disciplinary action ex officio and "in accordance with the law."
Mrs Lam also announced the nomination of the Vice-Chairman of the Committee for the Administration of the Communist Party (CPC), which would be chaired by the Deputy Director of the "Integrity of Integrity".
He said that the chairman of the commission of improper party-producing committees, chaired by Gu Xiong, was a non-second person, using the experience of Bacon Bacon in the past and would serve as the basis for the Commission's inventory of cases of misconduct related to the party.
"Today, as long as there is a party, no one will donate to your society today, and no one will give you a social contribution, and if the party is full-handed, the Kuomintang may request social support and sponsorship." There is no chance to go today. "
He also stressed that, even after the failure of the Communist Party's regulations, the Kuomintang party had not been completely confiscated, confiscated, and the remaining remains promised to go out, leaving the party to zero, and that the party should start from scratch.
The original title: "Corridor doctor" Lanzhou Lengfeng v. CCTV host Wang Zhian honour tort first instance failure
According to the speech of CCTV, Wang Zhian, a CCTV host, spoke on the incident of the "corridor doctor" on the Sina Weibo Weibo, Wang Zhiyong and Beijing Microdream Creation Network Technology Co. Ltd. v. Court.
Yesterday afternoon, Haidian District Court handed down the case, which found that Wang Zhian and Microdreaming Company did not constitute a violation and dismissed the claims of the Lengfeng.
At the beginning of 2014, the CCTV reporter Wang Zhixin found that despite more than 600 days in the hospital corridor, more than 600 days of Lengfeng had been shaped by the media to be the system's repressive hero, the reports had plenty of factual information.
On 29 March 2014, CCTV footage produced by the CCTV News Survey was broadcast.
All the so-called excessive medical information reported to the media by Lengfeng to the media is unsupported by evidence.
Wang Zhiyan also in the real name certified the microblog, described "Lanyfeng to this step is character, it has obvious paranoid personality and so on."
Lan Yue Feng asked Wang Chen to delete the microblog, apologize to him and compensate for the mental damage 100,000 yuan.
In the hearing at that time, the two sides argued about whether Wang Zhian violated the honorary right of the Lengfeng.
On December 12: The Chinese team in the Kasaï Occidental is busy looking forward to the breakthrough
The bicycle is expected to achieve a "zero breakthrough" for the Olympic gold medal, while the female football team will challenge the German team twice, expecting it to burst into four.
The last two seasons of Wang Zhen highlighted the silver medal of the Beijing athletics World Championships last year, and this year's group competed in the World Championships to upgrade the individual project champion.
Zhang Huihua, a 27-year-old Korean archer, won the gold medal in the female archery race, and won the Olympic gold medal after the group match.
Zhang Huihua was thought to be a late winner, who had unfortunately not got tickets to the last London Olympics, and now proudly stood on the top podium of the Rio Olympic Games.
She won the gold medal by defeating Lisa Onu of Germany with a total score of 6-2 in the finals of the Women's archery in Rio de Janeiro Park in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
She first shot her arrow at the fourth grade of the elementary school until the age of 27, until the age of 27, won the first gold medal in the World Cup, a late player.
Zhang Hui recalls that "there is no level before the upper secondary school so that it is not possible to take part in the national competition.
Zhang Hui, a four-year-old London Olympic athlete, won only the fourth, a pity to miss the Olympic tickets, only to take two gold medals as co-workers and good friends.
Zhang Huizong spoke of his gold medal after the ceremony of the female archery's personal race at the end of the ceremony, "until the end was as far as possible an arrow, which could lead to a good result and be satisfied.
The 28-year-old South Korean archery "one sister," the London Games archery individual gold medal winner Chifu times won the bronze medal.
In the semi-finals Chungfu lost to Zhang Hui in the semi-finals and competed for a bronze medal with the Mexican player Alejandro Valencia.
It is conceivable that Chateau-fu, while ensuring a bronze medal in a bronze medal, can be expected to bear the burden of gold in silence.
The first is that the training team has accumulated rich experience in the ongoing study, followed by a scientific training approach, which requires long-term accumulation.
The archery team focused on military training, night-crossing cemeteries and other methods to help the team concentrate and keep quiet.
Although it has not been confirmed, many sources say Apple's autumn conference in 2016 will be held in September, and the iPhone 7 is really coming.
But Apple didn't respond, but the new iPhone's functionality, configuration had come out, and even the iPhone 7 "real machine model" had been posted online.
A new generation of iPhones is a "big eye", hot, hot, rich... If you want the first time to buy positive products, you must choose a good channel, for example, Suining.
This adds to the disappointment of the new mobile phone, "it lengthened, but couldn't project the hologram!" The generation's iPhone is terrible. "
The iPhone 7, like other iPhone, was born before birth with countless secrets.
In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new generation of iPhones will cancel the 3.5-mm headphone interface and switch to Bluetooth connectivity and charging interfaces, which will provide space for Apple's second speaker.
Another evidence that corroborates this message is that Apple allows headphones to produce headphones that are connected to the charging interface early in 2014.
The news, or real, or false, the answer will not be known until Apple's release in the autumn of 2016.
But this does not prevent the industry from looking at the prospect of iPhone7 - many believe that iPhone7 will be likely to be the last big upgrade of Apple's iPhone series.
The market share of the iPhone has declined, despite the recent data published by market IDC.
Among them, Goldman kept Apple's shares on a "buy" rating, and BMO analysts said iPhone7 would reap a historic sales result.
At the same time, the company's CEOHockTan said Apple's future revenue increase would be more likely to exceed 20%, thanks entirely to the launch of the iPhone 7.
Seven percent of the respondents said they had plans to buy the iPhone 7, compared with only 4% of the number of subscribers planned two years ago.
It is understood that 20 per cent of users of the users of the iPhone 6 or 6Plus are currently planning to purchase the iPhone 7, a fairly high percentage.
Second, there is expert analysis, most of the fruit powder likes to replace their own iPhone cell phones.
According to statistics, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their mobile phones in 2 years, or nearly 120 million users have used the iPhone for two years.
According to the media, during the iPhone 7 production, Taiwan suffered a number of earthquakes, "the magnitude of the damage to the production facilities in Taiwan was beyond imagination and could have an impact on the initial iPhone 7 supply."
The contradiction of supply and demand affects ordinary users, and is the time to choose a good channel, first time to start the original iPhone 7.
Recently, Suining executives met with Apple in the near term to prepare sufficient supply sources, according to people familiar with the matter.
The operator has already negotiated with Suning, and it is foreseeable that, with the depth of cooperation between the two sides, it is bound to bring lower prices and more intimate services to the user.
"The lowest price, consumers may" need only seven yuan a day to buy the iPhone 7. "
There is plenty of good source and variety of preferences to buy the iPhone 7 no longer "pressure mountain big," and Suining's logistics will turn this beautiful into a more intuitive sense of experience.
Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night, "Hello, Suining, and your iPhone 7."

According to media, the "Green Pool" of the Rio Olympics has recently attracted attention since the diving pool from blue to green.
However, on the morning of October 10, water from the swimming pool adjacent to the vault became green.
The Australian pitcher said his eyes were tingling after the match and wanted to shed tears.
In the past, the Rio Olympic official confirmed the green condition of the pool and said the color of the pond was due to the weak base of the base, which would not affect the physical fitness of the athletes.
But the Australian athletes were stung by their eyes after winning the game with the Japanese team in the pool.
The organizers worked overtime at 9 pm to deal with the diving pool at the earliest after turning green at the diving pool, but found that the color of the water balloon changed rapidly on the morning of 10.
While the environment conditions of the water pool were gradually deteriorating during the Australian team and the Japanese team, officials stressed that they would return the water quality to their original colors on 11 November.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the Rio Olympic Games, said: "The degree of alkalinity in the vault was first weaker yesterday afternoon," said Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the Rio Olympic Games.
"We know a range of causes that may cause the color of the pond water, and the alkalinity of water quality."
The Water Sports Centre conducted a series of tests on water quality, and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the pool to determine the criteria for water quality. "
"These days we have been on the normal procedure, but we may lose sight of the more likely athletes will have an impact on water quality."
"But changes in water color certainly have no effect on health, especially for athletes."
"This independent team confirmed our assessment and confirmed the steps we took to restore normal colours and normal chemical conditions in the pool, "he said.
"We would have hoped the swimming pool would return to normal colors in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected by the rain."

On the morning of 12 August, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016.
The Director of the National Bureau of Statistics, the Director of the National Economic Integration Statistics Division, said that in July, some of the indicators of the national economy slowed down, but still operating within a reasonable range.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics show that data such as growth in fixed assets and total imports in July have fallen.
"As for the national economy running in July, I'd like to borrow a word that the prime minister has said," I want to borrow money from the prime minister, "he said." This is a good generalization of the features of the economic operation in July.
He explained that "volatile" refers to a slowdown in some economic indicators in July.
Since July's domestic and foreign economies are still undergoing deep adjustment, the international situation is complex and volatile, and the world economy has recovered less than expected, so the export pressure is still relatively large.
In the domestic context, the economy is still at a critical stage of adjustment, the adjustment of the adjustment has been released, and the economy is under considerable downward pressure, and some of the indicators are volatile.
It was noted that in July there was also a special case in which the floods were more severe and the hot weather had some implications for the production and operation of some regions.
According to the recent release of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, over 60 million people throughout the country were affected by direct economic losses amounting to over $20 billion.
In terms of industrial, investment and transport-related indicators, the varying levels of these areas are affected.
In July, the volume of cargo turnover slowed down 3.6 percentage points from the last month, and the floods had a certain impact on the traffic in those areas.
From these factors, the fluctuations in some indicators for the month of July are also normal and are expected to be expected.
"It's still good," he said, referring to the fact that, despite the slowdown in economic growth, the overall steady and steady flow of economic performance has not changed.
The CPI rose 1.8 per cent in July, rising 0.2 per cent over the world and 2.1 per cent in January-July, so the price situation remained generally stable.
According to the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau portal, the statistics of high temperature weather in each district, except Youyang, the rest of our city can receive a different degree of high temperature allowance.
At present, there are at least 28 provinces in the country with clear criteria for the issuance of allowances, although the standards issued by provinces and municipalities are not the same, while Chongqing receives high-temperature benefits in the form of a high-temperature working day allowance.
At least 37 ° C below 37 ° C, the rate of not less than 10 yuan per person per person per person per person per person is not less than 10 yuan per person per person per person per person per day, not less than 15 yuan per person per person per person per day.
At more than 40 ° C, high-temperature staff members receive up to 20 yuan / day benefits per month (except for workers already entitled to high-temperature assignment allowance in accordance with the law).
According to this standard, the state of the city with the highest temperature weather last month was 330 yuan, with the least number of days at least 80 yuan, while Youyang had no high temperature allowance because it did not meet high temperature standards.
In the past, many units used cool drinks to offset high-temperature benefits, and the City Anatown said the practice was not in line with the current approach.
The employing unit shall not deduct or reduce the wage of workers due to the cessation of the high temperature and the shortening of working hours.
According to the Municipal People's Bureau, employees who have experienced high temperature are seized to high-temperature allowances, which may seek legal rights and interests through the labour dispute mediation bodies in which the enterprise is located, or make an amount of 12333 complaints.
If the employing unit refuses to issue high-temperature benefits, the worker may complain to the competent department of social security of the human resources at or above the county level.
At the same time, due to the high temperature allowance is part of the wage, not benefits, it is to be included in the total wage, the deduction of a tax.
As a result, the high temperature allowance is not in the minimum wage and must be issued in cash and not in kind, such as beverages.
The newly established Urumqi station is located in the high-iron section of Urumqi City, with an entire building area of about 100,000 square metres.
The ground level 1, 2 layer for incoming station, waiting office and office, commercial space, the underground 1 layer is the standing layer.
At present, Urumqi is the largest integrated transport hub in Xinjiang, which integrates high-speed rail, rail transit, public transport, rental and so on.
There are three box offices on both sides of the platform and the north side of the station, with 39 manual tickets and 34 automatic vending machines.
With respect to the ticket, there are 30 channels on both sides of the waiting hall, and passengers can check and wait for a quick check, according to the ticket number on the ticket.
If you need help, you can select the 41 call button set up to the nearest station and you can get the timely service.
From July 1, the old passenger station, also the passenger train station in Urumqi Nan Station, proceeded to Urumqi station.
That is to say, all moving cars and 30 trains can stop at Urumqi Station.
The two stations are now able to buy tickets, and the passage of trains between them is about 10 minutes, and passengers need to pay attention to the exact date of the ticket and the destination of the terminal.
The official input of the new passenger station in Urumqi will be an important platform for Xinjiang to build a national comprehensive transport city and push forward the Silk Road Economic Zone and the construction of new zones.
Gray West is a budding female beak, all over the breath of tropical rain forest.
In the Central American country Costa Rica, the giant mouthbird Gracia and its story have long been known.
At a press conference on Aug. 10, Greeccia, recovered after surgery, unveiled its brand-new 3D printing plastic bird's beak.
It was only a year and a half before the man broke the beak, the dying giant beak, and finally regained his life.
This day not only proclaims its 100% recovery, but it moves into a luxurious birdhouse and meeting with its friends of human friends.
Greecia, who first entered the new home, was slightly shy, but not much more lively, playing in the water basin and eating grapes with a new beak.
To remind people of the damage it had suffered, the technicians did not dye the new bill, but retained the original white color of three-dimensional printing materials.
The beak of a bird is a thin layer of horny scabbard, which is hollow inside, and only a few thin bones crisscross.
Despite this internal reinforcement, the beak of the toucans bird is fragile and broken when it is hurt.
The animal rescue center, bird-class scientists and a American 3D printing company have worked together to produce several "test beaks" for gray West Asia, which finally built the perfect beak for its "perfect beak."
Today Greecia has been able to use new beaks to drink, eat, or peck the grain of grain.
"The final product design takes about two months, printing out for only four or five hours."
"3D printing isn't a futuristic technology, and it's actually entering your life," Thomas Langer, chairman of the SGD printing company, said in an interview with new international reporters.
In January 2015, in January 2015, a farm in Gracia, Central, Costa Rica, was found to have been found in the blood of Greeccia, a blood-blooded bird.
Its beak was brutally broken by a group of young people at the time, and it was completely unable to eat and were dying.
Gracia's woes provoked a tidal wave of anti-cruelty to animals both inside and outside of Costa Rica, following media reports.
The need for stricter animal protection laws and increased penalties for abusers was called for.
People came spontaneously and tried their best to help Grey Western Asia recover as soon as possible.
Even the 3D printing technology inventor Chuck Hull was involved in the design of Greeccia's beak.
"Gray is very special, and its beak is less than 1 cm in the remaining part of its beak, so it makes many difficulties for the installation of new beaks."
"We scan the gray area first, then design, produce a longer prosthesis that is slightly longer than the rest of its beak, with glue fixed on its beak."
"This could reduce further invasive injuries to Gracia," Longer told news.com.au.
Prior to the installation of prostheses, staff members are required to clean up their beaks every day to prevent infection.
Hundreds of thousands of miles away, the story of Greybird Gray touched the famous documentary director Paula Ereia and exploring news channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded the bit of Gracian's new beak and recorded a documentary "State bird," which was broadcast on the Animal Planet Channel this month.
The documentary "The Power of Big Bird" shows people how a small bird is how to make a country change, how to involve nationals in the fight against ill-treatment.
The core tip: Japanese oil companies are wary of the rise of small independent oil refineries known as the "teapot."
"China's export expansion is one of the reasons why China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the downturn," said Japan's largest oil company, JX Energy, reported on 12 August.
Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of small independent oil refineries known as the "teapot."
China's oil product quality is gradually approaching Japan's oil products due to the Chinese government's enhanced environmental protection regulations.
Before obtaining permission to import crude oil, the "teapot refinery" generally imported crude oil with a high sulphur content from places such as Russia.
The high sulphur content of petroleum products produced by production is one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining the import license for crude oil, the "teapot refinery" is able to import a lower sulphur content of Oman from crude oil and Russian crude oil, and the quality of its petroleum products has increased.
"With China's domestic oil product quality standards, the ability of refined oil refining equipment has also increased as China's domestic product quality standards continue to improve.
As a result, the quality of petroleum products exported to China has gradually reached the same level as Japan's highest quality. "
"After the end of 2015, China began to export high-quality light oil to Australia after the end of 2015," says JX Energy, competing with Japanese products in Asian markets.
Although Japan's high-quality oil is facing a crisis, the response strategy adopted by the Japanese oil-owned companies is "paying attention to market prices while exporting" unprofitable areas. "
As China's exports of petroleum products have a huge impact on the Asian market, the attention of the teapot refinery is also increasing.
In 2016, the Yangzi Evening Evening Community Sunshine Learning Program was launched on 26 May, after two months of registration, and the total number of needy students applying for bursaries amounted to more than 800 people.
In the course of the study, more than $1.2 million has been received from social contributions (which has been distributed in five batches), at least 240 cold-door dreamers.
At present, contributions continue, and the report calls on society to continue to reach out to more needy children to receive financial support and social care.

It is a famous charity brand in China, which is the famous charity brand in China, and the Yangzi Evening Evening Community Sunshine Education Program started in Jiangsu in 2003 to finance the cumulative surplus of more than 4,000 poor students.
The scope of this activity is the admission of new students from the college entrance examination, not exempt from tuition fees, high school education, family poverty.
The Bureau of Statistics indicated that New Zealand's population growth had previously been in excess of 2 per cent during the "baby boom" population in the early 1960s and early 1960s to the early 1960s.
As of June, New Zealand's 12-month net influx of immigrants into New Zealand was 61.9 million, a major driver of New Zealand's population growth in recent years.
In addition, the natural increase in the New Zealand population during the same time period was 2.82 million people.
The data show that in the last ten years, New Zealand's average annual net influx of immigrants was 2.1.8 million, with an average annual population growth of 32.3 million people.
From the demographic structure, the influx of large numbers of immigrants means that the proportion of "working age populations" between the ages of 15 and 39 is gradually increasing.
The New Zealand working-age population increased by 3.65 per cent to 1.85 million in the 12-month period as at June 2006.
At the same time, the increase in the number of older persons over the age of 65 is the same as 34.6 per cent, reaching 70,000.
At 10 a.m. yesterday morning, X9003 international freight class was set out from Xinjian Station, Xi'an, to Almaty, Kazakhstan.
The opening line of the train marks a successful breakthrough for the railway bureau in Xi'an since the opening of the Central Asian international freight class in 2013.
It is understood that the goods covered by the cargo class in this class cover industrial raw materials, mechanical equipment, industrial spare parts, building materials, food, light engineering products, and a total of 206 varieties.
As at 11 August this year, the new construction station opened a total of 221, 10009 vehicles in Central Asia, with a cumulative shipment of 33.8 million tons, of which 84 per cent were opened in 2016 and 47 per cent over the previous year.
It is understood that the first consignment of goods in Central Asia is "Made in Shaanxi," and today it has attracted a large number of field cargo sources.
By the end of July, the number of containers in Central Asian Banks reached 6.4 million marking boxes, an 8 per cent increase over the same period in 2015.
With the encryption opening line of the Central Asian class, the traffic volume of Xinjian railway station of Xi'an railway bureau has increased year by year.
In 2015, a total of 247.7 million tons of cargo will be delivered throughout the year, with freight forwarding reached 153.1 million tons as at 10 August 2016, an increase of 6.7 per cent over the same period last year.
In order to meet the needs of future development, Xi'an railway bureau has put in place a comprehensive logistics center construction planning for Xi'an Xinjian Railway Station as the center of the new construction railway integrated logistics park.
An Indian uncle, who had just landed at Dubai International Airport last week at Dubai International Airport, had lost $1 million in the same airport this week.
Mohammed Bashir Abdul Haidar, an Indian in Dubai, has a habit of buying lottery tickets every time he comes home.
His 21-year-old son was paralyzed by accident when he was born 13 days, and he had been working hard to repay his son's medical expenses.
"escape from the air crash was that God gave me two lives, and gave me the money to make me good," 赫达尔 said.
Although it is now Autumn, the power of the "autumn" seems to be a little worse than the summer.
The ultraviolet light not only makes the students skin blackened, will sunburn the skin, how to make the skin smooth through military training, do not get sunburn?
SPF and PA, SPF, and SPF are generally labeled with SPF and PA, which target UVB UV, and our common SPF index is 15, 30, 50, etc.
Products marked with PA are targeted at UVA, so that the sunscreen will play a more effective role, usually when the strength of PA is expressed with +, and more than one + represents an extension of effective protection time.
Oily skin should choose permeability strong water-borne sunscreen, and sunscreen spray is also a good choice.
Dry skin should choose frost-like sunscreen supplies; neutral skin generally does not strictly stipulate that any warranty on sensitive skin is a burden, and it is recommended that pure physical protection products be selected.
Remember to apply sunscreen in half an hour, as sun protection will take time to fully penetrate the skin.
When military training day long, sunscreen lotion every two hours can have a lasting effect, never be lazy.
Because the skin has just been stimulated by the sun, the military training does not come back immediately with whitening products.
After the military training, if the condition can be used towel wrapped ice to ice the town burns the skin to slow the local heat.
Farmers who buy farm machines during the exhibition will continue to implement progressive subsidy policies, and farmers purchase agricultural machinery with a maximum of 40% of subsidies.
At the present exhibition, the exhibition will be open to global merchants, especially by increasing the invitation to country and target market countries along the "road" along the road.
At the present exhibition, the exhibition aims to complete 60 contract signing projects, the introduction of $2.2 billion, and the conclusion of more than 160 trade contracts, with a contract amount of $3.2 billion.
It is known that the "Xiang Fair" has been settled for seven consecutive years, due to the strong base of manufacturing industry in Lou-se City, Hunan Province, which has a long history of industrial development.
As the host of the Expo, Loudi has established trade relations with more than 90 countries around the world.
The "Xiang Expo" has become an important platform for the development of specialty industries and the promotion of specialty industries from the country door.
In some nights, the ionosphere is full of free electrons, which means that radio signals can go further.
The United States Air Force is interested in replicating this effect, according to the monthly website on August 11.
While it may not be the interest of the United States Air Force to have a stable, free-electron ionosphere that can help people listen to the radio on the margins of a university radio station.
The electronic ionosphere means that the radio used by the military has a greater range of transmissions, and it may provide some protection to the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal to protect it from the impact of the solar storm.
The ultimate goal could be to create a series of CubeSat based on demand, which could strengthen the ionosphere while needed.
But first, the teams that have signed contracts with the Air Force must prove that the relevant scientific principles will work.
Industry figures show that the overall size of coal capacity in 2015 is close to 60 billion tons, with an excess of 1.8 billion tons of coal capacity across the country.
Over the last decade, the State Council has issued a total of five notifications to phase out surplus and backward production capacity before and after the State Council.
While the first four failed to target the coal industry, the target industry was directly linked to the coal industry.
Last November and January this year, last November, the price of 5,500 high-power coal in Qinhuangdao has been hovering at 370 yuan / ton, and 90% of coal companies fall into a loss.
The price of coal prices has risen steadily since February, and the recent rise in coal prices in Qinhuangdao has risen four weeks, rising to 436 yuan a tonne, up nearly 70 yuan from the beginning of the year.
With the price picks up, there is concern that there is concern that a batch of small mines will not be reinserted?
In this regard, the analysis and interpretation of the Director of the Institute for the Reform of the Institute of the Reform of China (Hainan) is conducted in this regard.
We are also concerned about the high level of attention paid by the parties to the production capacity, as well as the fact that the report card published today in the coal industry is a real concern.
These three layers of the surface reflect the reasons for the relative lag of our pattern of growth in the past, and that the government-led growth approach has not yet been fundamentally changed.
Second, it is also directly related to the advancement of local governments, where funding and accompanying measures are in place, and in this respect the difference is indeed greater in different regions.
Third, if some provinces with slower progress are moving ahead in the second half of the year, they are likely to be at greater risk.
In this context, the process of relying on central awards to boost capacity for productive capacity may have a negative impact.
In the first place, it is not simple to control the total amount of production capacity.
Our aim is to optimize the construction of the whole coal industry by eliminating backward production capacity, pushing forward the optimization of the structure.
In the process of deploying capacity to productive capacity, local governments will have to combine the upgrading of productive capacity and coal industry to develop relevant services.
Secondly, we should give full play to administrative oversight and administrative oversight if we want to finish this year's capacity-building tasks this year.
Finally, we need to strengthen the backstop role of social security.
Because the market is directly related to the problem of employment, we need to strengthen job skills training for employees and workers.
The lower ranking is due to the expected deterioration of foreign investment in GDP growth in the medium term.
Brazil's participation in global direct investment was 3.7 per cent in 2015, down from 5.7 per cent in 2014.
The IMF International Investment Attraction Index includes four sub-items: Infrastructure, economic prospects, business environment and direct investment.
Brazil's international direct investment in 2015 was $646 billion, down from $731 million in 2014.
Last year, the investment model of "greenfield investment" in Brazil (investment model for foreign investment sets) was $179 billion, a 2.1 per cent reduction over the previous year.
There are 288 "greenfield investment" projects in Brazil, compared to 314 in 2003 to 2014.
In Brazil, however, international direct investment in Brazil reached $338 billion in the first half of 2016, an almost 10 per cent increase over the same period last year.
Original title: Killing of a supporter of the Canadian police: A home-made bomb attack is nearing the end of the city's preparations
The taxi company said the taxi was assigned to Deiffer's house before the police arrived.
The Canadian police said in a press conference Wednesday that the information received by the police included the "martyrdom video" on the youth to be attacked by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation.
In the video, a man with a black hat was reading the Koran, referring to crimes against Muslims, and vowed to launch an attack on a city in Canada soon.
He said in the video that the attack took place within 72 hours and was at rush hours.
The incident was the first time that the police first shot a terrorist suspect before the incident took place last year by Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada.
After upgrading the renovation of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, the old Wanfu River, the North Great Leasing channel, the toll fee will be levied on September 1.
These two tributary channels adopt social financing ways to rebuild construction, charge has been approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government.
The old Wanfu river channel runs through the Golden Township and the fish platform, entering the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal via the Nanyang lake, with a total length of 32.5 km.
According to the navigation need, the old Wanfu river channel adopts the method of conservation reform, the local water depth is done deep, the local sharp curve is cut straight and so on, the navigation conditions can be improved.
The channel flows through Jinxiang County, Nintendo City, and Nanyang Lake into the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, which is 19 kilometres long.
The renovation of the two waterways began construction in February 2011 and completed in January 2015, with the completion of the delivery and acceptance in January 2015, the construction and operation of the construction and operation of the Anping Canal Logistics Service Centre in Jinan City.
According to the principle of "loan construction and repayment of fees," the Jining Canal Logistics Service Centre shall levy tolls on the basis of the fee standard for the approval of Prices in Shandong Province.
Of these, the base toll fee is calculated at 1.75 yuan / load, and mileage tolls are charged at 0.05 yuan / km.
The tolls date from 15 June 2016 until 14 June 2019.
From Jinan City, the reporter learned that there were four charging channels in Jining, respectively, for the Seung-soo River waterway, the White Horse River, the North Sea channel, the old Wanfu river channel.
Article 4 The channel of channel is the tributary channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, which takes the form of social financing to upgrade.
The Seung-soo River Watercourse Upgrading Project is the first to adopt the "government + market" model, which is used for projects in the construction of inland waterway transport in Shandong Province, which represents the main investment and the financing gap of social funds.
It is the mode of pure market operation of the feeder channel such as the White Horse River, the Old Wanfu River and the North Great River.
The funds allocated by the State are not able to meet the needs of engineering construction and restrict the progress of the upgrading of the waterway.
The allocation of social funds for public infrastructure is in line with the requirements of national policy and has also become a means of cracking down the financial bottlenecks.
Ningzhang's performance in the 100-meter freestyle semi-finals has left many Chinese audiences speechless.
In the 50-meter freestyle pre-stroke, Ningbo again refreshed people's "bottom line."
In fact, the 50-meter freestyle is not the master of Ningzhang, his performance and best achievements at the Kanhill World Championships, and the likelihood of his breakthrough in this project is unlikely.
As a matter of fact, the Hong Kong authoritative mass media Bulletin revealed that the biggest reason for the defeat of Ningbo was that he had lost interest in swimming.
Many factors off the sidelines could have a big impact on his ideas for the future, and he is now likely to be more interested in moving into entertainment circles.
After Kazan Expo, Ningzao became net red by virtue of its ultra-high-value and good grades.
As a result, the name of "national husband," "small meat", "pattern beauty" and so on also constantly became the label of him.
All kinds of business activities look for the door, good money, become a golden light flashing avenue.
In this case, Ningbo, even if it chooses to retire into entertainment circles at this time, is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly viable road.
After all, he is only 23 years old and has been able to play a series of TV dramas with his popularity.
But Ningbo, however, needs to see if he has enough qualifications compared to those of these predecessors?
At the Sydney Olympics in 2000, Liu Xuan, a 21-year-old, had come to the end of his career as an athlete.
Liu Jiaxuan's appearance made her quick to remember, and laid the foundation for her future march into entertainment circles.
After his retirement, Liu Xuan played a series of TV dramas and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tian Liang took part in the two Olympic Games single double-meter race, and got 2 gold 2 gold.
But after losing to teammate Hu Jia in the single 10-meter race in the 2004 Olympic Games, Tian Liang's competitive state was falling and kicked out of the diving team.
And he and his daughter took a variety show, such as "where Dad went," and he made him earn the eye.
The former gymnastic gold generation, Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng, and Chen's ice are high-profile in various variety show.
It is worth mentioning that Yang Wei Li Xiaopeng led China to the 2008 Olympic champion of the Olympic Games, and Yang Wei received personal all-round gold medals twice and was called the King of All.
Chen Gang, while leading China to the 2012 Olympic team champion, also became king ring king.
At the London Olympics, after a miscarriage of justice, Chen's move was a big move, and he left him with a lot of powder.
But the main energy of these athletes is still in the field, and the show is just like a dragonfly.
But whether retired or active athletes, it is necessary for the entertainment industry to be able to enjoy the performance of the game.
After all, the athlete step into a new field, whether capacity or person, is a blank state.
Even if it was Tian Liang, Liu Xuan, many years of "old people," the average audience brought them up and thought about their performance at the Olympics.
But Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and other new people, in the introduction of the show, all without exception are "Olympic champions."
Compared to the above, the title of a swimming World Championships in Ningbo is still slightly thin.
Besides, the negative impact of Ningbo on its image is likely to be an incalculable negative effect on the image of people such as Tian Liang, Liu Xuan, Yang Wei and others.
After all, the demands of the sportsman, the demands of the people are "no more than a hundred fights, but it is not hard to be afraid," and the distance of Ningbo is still a bit worse.
Returning to ten thousand steps, Ningzao has long to be handsome, can rely on the color to obtain the support of thousands of brain residual powder.
There is no power, only on the appearance, want to be in the entertainment industry, it is not more difficult to get back to the state.
The road to life is the choice of individual will, but on the way to choose, Ningbo's heart should know what to do.
On the surface, the network social platform expands the communication circle, reduces the sense of loneliness.
The network's social sphere of influence is becoming more widespread, not only gradually replacing traditional telephone contact, even infiltrating the real life circle of the line, quietly changing the social life of the people.
The benefits of online social networking are obvious, such as convenient and fast, so it is especially easy to be favored by young people.
According to a survey of social habits of college students, 57% of college students use mobile phones for more than five hours a day, and their daily lives are basically "hand-held hands."
"Social networking has the characteristics of low cost, fast transmission speed and simultaneous communication, and meets the needs of contemporary college students."
Expanding relationships, more equal dialogue, and avoiding social concerns are the main causes of our growing love on the line.
New people who have just entered the company love to communicate with co-workers, "because they are not familiar enough to enter the unit, the relationship is much closer than ever before."
I love you not because of who you are, but because of who I am when I am with my friends because I haven't been in touch with my friends for some time.
The IT engineer Wu said he was a deep-network social enthusiast, and most of his social life was on the line, and the network contacts were multiplied by the number of friends around the line.
Wu said he also confessed that it was more "fish to water" on the Internet.
"You can reply to your friends at your own convenience, because there are a lot of time-consuming statements and they can be expressed more clearly."
"you are hidden under your ID to avoid a face-to-face interpersonal collision, not only a room for manoeuvre, but even more time and space for each other.
"People with different identities have the same rights and efficiency to speak, and social concerns in real life seem to be eliminated in cyberspace."
But Wu said Xiao Peng, a friend of Wu, felt that Wu's speech in life was a "rather dull man."
Xiao Peng and Wu spoke in a large group, because both of them were active speakers and soon became familiar.
Xiao Peng thought that Wu said that Wu spoke to two people on the Internet, and the words were dull, and did not offer their opinions. It was a few words, "ha ha, OK, yes," said Xiao Peng, "I want to check it on the Internet."
The Ling Shui Police is now involved in the investigation, and the Ling Shui Transport Department will also strengthen its efforts to combat illegal operating vehicles.
"On August 4, the conflict police did not look into the results, and on Aug. 11, the other two drivers had been hit by a taxi in their homes."
"The tricycle is now operating illegally at night and it is hoped that the authorities will step up our efforts to improve it."
The Public Security Bureau of the South China Sea Network is aware of the fact that the police are now receiving reports of both cases, the causes of the two cases, the reasons for which they are and whether any association is being investigated.
At the beginning of the year, the traffic department of the Lingling Water Transport Department said the traffic department began to combat illegal operating passenger tricycle at the beginning of the year, and a total of 613 illegal operators were banned.
The next step, the traffic department will apply to the county government to improve the administration of illegal operating vehicles such as tricycle, motorcycle, black car and other illegal operating vehicles in the county.
At 8 a.m. on 11 August, Zulu Evening reporter followed the "Healthy China line" Medical Services Teams to the West Lake District of the West Lake District.
The village is located in remote areas, approximately 24 kilometres from the city, more than 200 kilometres from the urban area, and more than 200 inhabitants of the village, owing to limitations in economic, transportation and physical conditions, have caused inconvenience to many middle-aged patients.

After this case, after a number of media reports, it became the focus case, the social impact is very bad.
In the case of the case, the criminal investigation of the criminal investigation of the criminal investigation was carried out immediately after the incident took place, and the investigation was carried out by the Police Public Security Bureau of the Public Security Bureau of the City Public Security Bureau.
The police immediately executed the suspect in pursuit of the Internet, taking a variety of measures to control, and investigating the whereabouts of a country by contacting the police in the field.

The Greenland sharks are also known as small head sleep sharks, which are widely distributed between Greenland and the North Atlantic coast around Iceland, reaching between 4 and 5 metres long in adulthood.
But their growth rates are extremely slow, sometimes about 1 cm long in 1 year, suggesting that Greenland sharks may have a very long life span.
The traditional methods of measurement are typically used in animal calcification organizations, which may be used in some sharks, but this calcification organization is rare in Greenland.
The new study led by Uliu Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, turned to the use of an eye lens of the Greenland sharks to carry out radioactive carbon measurements.
This method has previously been used to determine the age of whales, but for the first time to determine the age of fish such as sharks.
Their analysis shows that the maximum shark life is estimated at 392 years, with an error of 120 years.
This means that this shark is at least 272 years old, most likely to reach 512.
In addition, the female Greenland sharks are said to have attained the age of about four metres to maturity and to be converted into age at least until the age of 156.
The researchers therefore wrote in the paper that the Greenland sharks are known to the Earth, the most long-lived vertebrate, surpassing the previous long-lived champion dehumpback whale (211).
There has been a significant improvement in the exchange rate since a year, and the renminbi's exchange rate has remained basically stable, and has also laid the foundation for promoting the internationalization of the renminbi.
In terms of market performance, the two-way floating exchange rate of RMB exchange rate is obvious in the past year, and the rate of exchange rate is stronger and the exchange rate is expected to be stable.
Since the change to the current, the renminbi against the United States dollar intermediate price of more than 100 points and up and down frequently appeared, but the process of lowering and alternating.
Last year, last year, the last conversion measure before the "8-11" Convergence was implemented in 2005 and the renminbi appreciated significantly over the past decade.
Since the reform of the renminbi has changed, the renminbi has changed before the renminbi has changed, and the value of the renminbi's exchange rate has depreciated by about 8 per cent over the previous year.
On 1 October this year, the International Monetary Fund would formally accept the renminbi as the SDR (SDR) weighting currency.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, will travel to Kenya to attend the sixth African Development Conference in late August, according to China's Voice of Journalism.
The African Development Conference, led by Japan, was held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, for the first time, and the meeting would therefore be the first migration to Africa.
In that regard, Foreign Ministry officials in Japan indicated that the convening of meetings on the ground in Africa had helped to bring the attention of African and European countries to Japan.
To co-ordinate Mr Abe's visit to Shinzo Abe, it was reported that the Japanese LDP would send a group of negotiators to the countries concerned.
Japan's "entry" approach began in the early 1990s, and the African Development Conference, launched by Japan, began in 1993, not a coincidence!
Africa, which has 53 seats in the United Nations, is an important slot for the United Nations, and Japan wants to "get into it" and how to abandon Africa?
Exchange of views on extremist groups "Islamic State" and terrorist activities will also be exchanged with relevant national counterparts.
The Western Group will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau.
Japan's Foreign Minister, Kishida Fumio, has also recently stated his intentions on the African Development Conference in the United Nations Security Council.
Abe has announced in this connection that in order to stabilize sub-Saharan African countries, it will provide 10 billion yen (RMB 61 billion yuan) aid in five years.
There has been general agreement among observers that Japan's generosity towards Africa has been largely aimed at increasing the presence of Japan in Africa; second, to win support from African countries on a regular basis.
"In terms of politics, although Africa has lagged behind in relative development, Japan has always regarded it as the so-called" big ticket field, "said Yang Bang, an expert on Japan.
Japan will not give up in the future, and the work on Africa will not end, and will be strengthened.
In the economic sphere, as Japan's productive capacity is relatively strong, domestic markets are relatively limited, especially in the context of the ageing of young children, and domestic demand is relatively low.
However, from 10 years ago Junichiro Koizumi, after 10 years of Abenzo Abe, Japan has repeatedly launched its "sprint" that has been unsuccessful.
Yang Bojiang, a Japanese expert, is of the opinion that the frequent intentions of Japan are clear, but that getting into the usual way is bound to be fraught with difficulties.
Japan needs to have a right attitude to achieve its own goals, first and foremost with neighbouring countries, and Japan needs to have a right attitude, both in geopolitics and in national disputes, as well as historical awareness.

Liu Administration went to Sanya to study "pair and pair" to raise the urban level of the city
On the morning of December 12, Liu gave you a colloquially and listened to the report on the progress of the pilot project "Two cities" in the city of Sanja and the comments made by the departments concerned.
Liu gives you full recognition of the milestones achieved in the pilot exercise and the good experiences and good practices that have been created.
Mr Liu stressed that Sanya had to seize the opportunity of historical development to "double-repair" double-city "double-city" pilots and play a leading role in the overall economic and social development of the province.
We should play a leading role in upgrading the international level of international tourism, starting with a few details, enriching international elements and forging international boutique.
To play a leading role in urban and rural integration and global tourism, accelerate the construction of the town town, integrate the tourist elements into each project, and make every country and town in Sanya a tourist area.
To play a leading role in "Operation Social Investment 100 Days" to promote a number of major projects and parks to ensure the landing of high-quality projects and the implementation of the requirements of large-scale operations.
Committee Secretary Zhang Qi, Deputy Governor Wang Road, the provincial government secretary, Land Land, participated in the study.
Deng Yaping, who won 18 world championships in 14 years, became the first to win four gold medals in Olympic history.
She was ranked first in the world in 8 consecutive years, and was the world's longest female athlete in table tennis.
On 26 September 2010, the Under-Secretary-General for People's Day and General Manager of the People's Search Network, the General Manager of the People's Search Network, is a senior official.
Today, she will work together with Yu Minhong to create the first innovative platform for entrepreneurship in the country.
There are also such a group of star coaches on the Chinese altar: They are infinite in the age of the athletes, winning countless glory for the country; after retiring, they will be taught for years.
Huang Yuanbin, as the first world champion of Chinese men's gymnastics, chose to pick up the whip after his retirement.
Huang Yuanbin has created a "Olympic gold group" from coaches to male coaches, and Huang Yuanbin has created a "Olympic gold group," and the team won nine gold-4 silver-4 bronze in the Beijing Olympic Games.
Since then, Tian Liang has been advertising advocacy continuously, especially in recent years, has played an important role such as "Lang Lang" and "Lei Feng."
Many NBA players attest to their strength, but there has been a decline in people's progress.
Whether it's because of age or time constraints, there will be a number of setbacks in the performance of some players every season.
Of course, some "retrogression" may be just the shrink of data, and the ability of these players may not fall.
Even Wade is one of the best scoring defenders in the league, but he doesn't have a hot temper at the bull's performance.
He had a limited range of backyards, with only 32.8% of the three-point hit at home star Butler, which allowed them to attack the next season.
When I came to the wind city, the lightning-man had to give more to Butler and Londo, and he was likely to opt for a regimen in the regular season.
Occaf's situation was awkward and as the first option for 76 people last season, he had to compete with Simmons at the new season, as well as the right to play the game.
The competition may not be coming soon, and Simmons will need to adapt to the NBA, and Nambiar will be able to recover fully from his injury as soon as possible, but whether Aukfu has a position in 76 long-term PFDJ remains a problem.
The last season, 32% of Oakafford scores came from low-level attacks, which was higher than Cox, Vučević and Brook López, while his use was also high.
With Simmons already showcased the excellent ball forward, Nabilia has a better shape for NBA games, and Okaw's status is unlikely to be so shaky.
In the past two seasons, Thompson's use has stabilized at the top 20 of the league, and this is the last two seasons of his career.
The question, however, is that, with Durant's arrival, Thompson's use is bound to fall, which will inevitably affect his play.
This impact will not only be an impact on the number of shots, but the goal of Temphis will also be greatly reduced next season, which in some respects also reduces his opponent's difficulty in defending him.
Durant's arrival is bound to get the Warriors' players to shrink, but perhaps the worst of them is Thompson.
But this does not mean that the level of 汤神's level step, more like his sacrifice for the team as a whole.
Parker showed better than the data in the last season, not only because his basket efficiency came to the top of his career, and his chemical reaction to Aldridge also benefited the Spurs.
Duncan retired, and Giano Billy announced another year of war, and the GDP portfolio eventually reached an end as the youngest of the three men, and there was little oil in the fuel tank of the French sports car.
After getting the third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell James won more regular MVP, and Jordan is the only one who has FMVP more than James.
Oh, yes, James has just brought Cleveland to Cleveland for the first 52 years of the first professional sports championship trophy.
James, who has come to the 14th season of his career, needs better physical strength to prepare for the playoffs.
As a result, James's data may be further down in the regular season, and he will share more of his burden to Owen, but he can easily become a former player in the league.
"It is necessary to spread the talent learned from the country to Russia."
On the 12th of the day, Huang Jing, the president of the Moscow Chinese Federation of overseas Chinese, said he was excited when he saw the reporters.
Recently, she participated in the "Chinese Talent (calligraphy, painting) training course for the overseas Chinese cultural community," hosted by the Chinese Office for Affairs Abroad and hosted by the University of Jinan.

After returning to Moscow, we must use the knowledge and skills learned to make a contribution to the spread and promotion of Chinese culture.
The same feeling was also felt by the Secretary-General of the Russian Association for the Advancement of Chinese Culture, which took part in the training course.
She said she had made great progress with the help of the teacher training course and felt the burden of being "Chinese culture overseas communicator."
Zhang said the Chinese traditional culture should be spread and promoted among Chinese and Chinese people who love Chinese culture after returning to Russia.

The British team won silver in the seven-man rugby match and the Fiji team won the gold medal
The British team was unable to perform the outstanding performance before the Fijians team in the seven-man rugby match on Thursday night, defeated by the Fijian team in Rio + 7 in Rio + 7.
The Fiji team won the gold medal with impeccable performance in control, breaking, avoiding, cooperating, running and power, which is the first Olympic medal in the country.
The silver medal was a great comfort to the defeated English team, and the silver was the third silver medal that the British delegation had received the same day: They beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on the seven-man rugby match for the first time in the Olympics.
Earlier that day, the British team beat the South African team at 7 to 5, which could have an impact on their status in the final.
But in any case, the current Fijians team is enough to defeat an energetic 15-person team.
Tomorrow, at least one Englishman will wear a gold medal, which may be a comfort to the British team, but it may not be. The Englishman who comes from Winboston coach Ben Ryan, has served as the British team manager.
It is not easy for the British team to achieve today's achievements.
Eight years ago, in Ryan's coaching, they had not tasted the fruit of the rugby football game in Adelaide.
And now they're just a step away from the champion.
Although they were hit by a huge blow, they had made remarkable progress.
Fiji took advantage of the opening ceremony, making it impossible for the British team to do its part.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like a series of is buses. When 欧西 hedge rushed into the flag area, the World Series championship was well ahead of the score.
After only four minutes of the game, Jerry Tucker scored on the right-wing touchdown.
At 12 to 0, the British team hardly met the ball.
Mitchell's robust interdiction led to a third score of the Giant Lyons Carrava, but it merely slowed the rate of Fiji's score.
Seven minutes later, the British team made a dent in the right-to-the-right corner, and at 17 to 0, the British team added.
The caravans got another point, and the game... the first half of the game was still one minute left.
Then Watt LaWarwick broke through the British team's defense and went straight to the point of scoring.
When the midfield breaks, the score is 29 to 0.
The Fijians seem to have been born seven-man rugby, and the British team is still the first.
This is the case.
The British team made great changes in the second half and hit Fijians in the second half, and the performance was good for the first half, but Fijaya Tuessova scored again.
Dan Norton gave the British team the chance to score. He struck the left corner and changed the score to 36 to 7, but the game was already in control of the South China Sea Island countries, with their fans singing, waving flags and singing songs on the platform.
The wonderful performance of the Fiji team was compelling.
Matata William's last moment prevented the Fiji team from playing an unquestionable offensive.
When the final whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced, and the defeated British team could only regret leaving.
Earlier in the day, the Fiji team defeated Japan in the semi-final in the semi-final, while the UK won the Africa in a fierce semi-final showdown.
In the first half, Kyle Brown helped the South African team lead, but Dan Norton scored in the second half with excellent foot-breaking points.
The England team won the silver medal after his brother Marcus Watson, the England team's brother, captured the team's victory with a wonderful intercept.
Helen Graf and Heather Stein were encouraged by cancer-related coaches to win the gold medal
It is no exaggeration to say that this is the most touching one of the gold medals.
From the first paddle to the present, Helen · and Heather Stanning have accepted 220 punitive 拉举 training, and the gold medal that they won in Estacio da is more remarkable.
But there's only one person on the boat, but one of them - coach Robin Williams - has been accompanied by a second female double-oar Olympic gold medal with them, and this is the UK's first woman to meet the height of the kayak.
They have maintained 39 unbeaten records and have an absolute advantage.
What we saw was the grace of the two talented players on the surface, but it was not the whole of this victory.
There is a lot of voluntary help behind every rowing gold medal, and their constant dedication has been created differently than a coach who learned that he had cancer 30 months ago and did not know if he could live to see the day.
As he said, death could come at any time.
I've got a bladder cancer. They have surgery for me.
If you don't operate, the cancer cells spread all over the body.
This is going to be much worse.
This will change your opinion slightly.
Williams was diagnosed as cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he had begun treatment early in 2014 to minimize the impact, although in such cases it might not be appropriate.
I need to get paid, so I must hurry up.
This is an incentive for me.
I live in the hospital, though they say it's enough to go a few steps, but I walk around 20 feet, 30 feet and 50 feet in the ward every time.
This is all the starting point.
The rowing movement itself is a journey, which makes this journey a bit longer.
At the moment of gold, they first thought of Williams. Williams was talking slightly more than usual today, in order to overcome his anxiety.
"I've been in a bad mood this week, maybe a bit extreme, but the gold medal is really extraordinary," she said.
It has repeatedly told me how important it is to me, and I, Helen and Robin have made much effort.
Helen, Robin and I worked for three years.
If we don't have Robin, we're just nobody. Thank him very much. He's the best coach in the world.
I'm not likely to find a better trainer and coach than him.
Helen Graf and Heather Stein have not been successful in five years.
The penalties imposed on the combination are not comparable to their opponents.
Even in the last 500 metres, the New Zealand team and the Danish team began to close, Stanning and Grave still had plenty of physical energy reserves.
It was really amazing at the time.
Helen cried, "Keep the rhythm and keep pace."
It is really important not to be affected by an opponent.
We have a very good start, and we don't look forward to doing something amazing.
We didn't go to the glory of today, we were just thinking about rowing each oar and winning the game, and we did it.
It took a year to determine the future of the combination.
Grave will marry Steve Barton, a television explorer next month.
But now she wants to enjoy the moment.
I don't want to say that this is my last game.
This will bring me too much pressure.
In London, I spent about six months to realize that I was the Olympic champion.
This is a new experience, and I feel very nervous.
It is now about four minutes away.
"I feel much better," she said.

The "cartoon" effect of Snapchat is a satire for Asians
Snapchat indicates that this filter is inspired by animation, but some observers believe it has ethnic colors.
The 1.5 billion day-to-day users of Snapchat can change reality through their filter tools and make them ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character in the picture of Roy Livingstone.
These lenses have the effect of passivation and bending characteristics, which produces more than 30 million unmodified self-photographs on a daily basis.
Any failure will immediately be brought to the attention of the public.
The Snapchat lens has been criticized for being inspired to play black or white skin for beauty.
So when the app this week provided some users with a filter that could create a , weird tooth, and a pink face effect, some critics called it a racial satire on Asia's "Yellow Man".
They even consider whether these recurring problems mean that the company has a bigger problem on diversity.
On Wednesday The Vergeek and Motherboard report sparked outrage after Snapchat says its deletion of the function.
The company's explanation is that the filter is a tribute to anime characters, not to satirical Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of the stereotype that is harmful in reality.
Others are also strongly opposed to these anime images.
In an e-mail message from a Korean-American art published on these photographs and widely shared by Korean-American art, "these filters" are "at least uncomfortable and uncomfortable."
She also said: "It is difficult to distinguish between a highly disgusting Asian ironic image and the effect of a filter."
In spite of the fact that the filter is not only the yellow species, the yellow species are extremely belittled.
Snapchat is not the only company that touches these cultural lines.
American culture seems to be promoting diversity and inclusiveness from corporate boards to Hollywood and the equipment we carry.
The larger young population of Snapchat is likely to be very sensitive because of a greater focus on ethnic diversity than older generations.
When Snapchat's screen produced an insult to the user's image, a 25-year-old Zhu Katie, a 25-year-old, said in an interview Thursday: "This kind of thing is more difficult than ever."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an essay and a telephone interview written in writing, she said that racial controversy reflected the lack of ethnic diversity in the recruitment process by Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's employees for the majority of whites and the leadership was all men and added a tag at the end of the article: # DeleteSnapchat.
As a Chinese-American, Ms Zhu said: "Either they have no color in their staff so they can make such a decision, or there are some of the people of colour in their staff, but their positions do not allow them to speak out."
Other observers shared her complaint that she had not responded to Snapchat.
The company did not publish data on the diversity of employees and said that he was a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial background of its employees, but a spokesman said the company had recently hired a recruiter to focus on low-level segments of the population as well as work to promote internal inclusiveness.
Ms. Zhu said she would close her Snapchat account: "I want to know if they need more users like us to oppose it."
The Congressional team says military officials distort ISIS intelligence
In a report released Thursday by a congressional panel, a congressional team noted that officials from the United States Central Command changed intelligence reports and would be more optimistic about the war in Iraq and Syria than in reality.
The mid-term report came from a dedicated working group set up by the House Military Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the House Allocation Committee's National Defence Sub-Commission, which reported that the central command intelligence analyst had "widespread dissatisfaction" that the superiors were tampering with their assessment of the United States battle with the Islamic State.
The Central Command, located in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters to oversee the United States military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news report on the report, "intelligence verified by the senior command of the Central Command is more optimistic than the actual situation in the United States, and has always been more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies."
The Republican representative of California said: "The conduct of the Central Command is difficult to accept. One side is that our fighters are suffering from war, on the other side is the wrong analysis of senior policymakers."
The leadership of the Central Command has been extended to the highest level of the institution.
The report details the long-standing problems of the Central Command in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analysing the United States training for Iraqi forces.
While there is no conclusive evidence that senior officials from the Obama administration have ordered changes to the reports, they feel that they are under pressure from central command leaders to make more optimistic comments on the threat posed by ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, the report states that" in the first half of 2015, many central headquarters press releases, statements and congressional testimony are much more optimistic than the actual situation. "
For example, a central command official has publicly indicated that a major military operation could be taken back to Mosul in April or May 2015.
In Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, Mosul are still under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, the results have been clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican representative of Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most senior intelligence officials from the Central Command of the United States manipulated intelligence products from the command and concealed the threat from ISIS.
The Republicans set up a dedicated working group after the Republicans learned from analysts about the manipulation of intelligence from the Islamic State.
As the survey continues, more discoveries will be found following the report released Thursday.
The Attorney General of the Ministry of Defence has also conducted a long-term investigation into the Central Command.
The Democrats of the House Intelligence Committee released its findings on Thursday, in line with some of the findings of the Republican Task Force.
In a statement by the Democratic Leader of the Commission, the Democratic Leader of the Commission, in a statement, said that between 2014 and 2015, the Central Command developed an overly narrow process for intelligence assessments of ISIS and Iraqi peacekeeping forces. "
Mr. Xie said the process "hinders the release of intelligence, reduces the morale of analysts and" cannot accept different opinions. "
But Mr Xieandar and Democrats also say they have found no evidence that the White House is trying to pressure analysts at the central command, so that their conclusions fit "default or political narratives."
The beast daily reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of the congressional investigation.
Last August, the New York Times reported that the Attorney-General of the Pentagon started an investigation after receiving complaints from central command analysts.
The Pentagon spokesman, Patrick Evans, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the congressional report until the Attorney-General's investigations were closed.
But he said: "Experts sometimes disagree over the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the MoD encourage a healthy dialogue on these important national security themes."
The impact of the survey has outpaced the success of the United States-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria (as claimed by an increasing number of Ministry of Defence officials).
But last year, these claims raised the public's doubts about the extent to which President Obama could trust the military action assessments issued by the Central Command in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of the Islamic State's intelligence was reminiscent of the controversy over a decade ago when the Central Command Intelligence Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a study stating that George W. Bush's government insisted on sending small-scale troops to Iraq without taking into account the situation following the invasion of 2003.
Mr. Dahuk played a key role in the campaign against the intelligence of the Islamic State.
Last year, officials said Mr. Dahuk's team had concluded that air strikes against the Islamic State refinery did not significantly reduce the economic revenues of terrorist organizations, as the terrorist organization built an interim refinery to continue selling oil on the black market, which was quite different from that published.
According to reports from Time Weekly, the Central Command did not disclose the findings to the public.
When a number of lawyers reviewed the Senate testimony of an overoptimistic assessment of the war, the central command commander, Lloyd Austin III, was criticized last year.
General Austen retired in April and is now replaced by Joseph Volt for his position at the Central Command.
The United States won four wins in women's hockey and will win a victory with the UK
Katy Bloom, the only one in the fight against Japan in June, helped the US women's hockey team to take the lead on Thursday to help the U.S. team beat India in 3-0.
The two games scored four goals, but the 27-year-old Babum said she didn't know how good he was doing.
"I don't know anything about that," she said.
I'm not the kind of guy who will remember myself in a few balls.
What she knew was that the United States had won four consecutive victories in the Olympics and would compete with the team on Thursday with 2-0 victory over the Japanese team.
Britain and the United States met on Saturday in the first round of the last match.
Both teams are ready to make a quarter of the finals, and the match will determine who will be in the first position of the group.
The team's first team will avoid having a strong Dutch team, so that the Dutch team will be able to go further. The Dutch team is in the first position of another group.
The United States made a miracle in Saturday's game, with the U.S. Team at the bottom of the 12 teams four years ago at the London Games.
Bassam was also among the team at that time.
Growth grew up in whelped, Pennsylvania, and first picked up a hockey stick (her twin sister in 德雷克塞尔) at the age of 3 and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming the youngest member of the national team to date.
Unable to be selected for the final list, she missed the 2008 Olympics.
In 2012, she and her teammates were not promising.
In the second year, British Craig Patassé was the manager of the coach, and everything began to change.
"This is a cultural, mindset and substance change," Bloom said.
We haven't reached the current level in London at that time.
We came here once and for a while.
On Thursday night, Baram scored with a shot from close range in the first half.
India had not tasted the fruit in the current game, but the team showed an amazing tenacity and stayed at the end of the third section at the end of the third quarter, when Bam broke out.
She took the ball on the left side of the court, and then went to the middle of the road and shot the net, and the United States team was in the lead.
Melissa González scored the last goal in the medium term of section IV.
The United States jackie for the first time in this game, and in the first three victories, the opponent scored a goal.
This time she was a superman.
And Bassam is too.
"We're in a good state now," Parnham said. But how much better will depend on the outcome of the Saturday game.
The shabby food of the Great Depression during the big meal
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had just been elected President of the presidency in March 1933, sat in the office of the President for lunch.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt liked the gourmet fare of Fifth Avenue, such as goose liver sauce and margarine stewed water fish.
That day, his menu was simple: Ketchup Devil eggs, mashed potatoes, and fruit pudding as dessert.
"This is for people who are suffering from the suffering of people who are suffering," Jane Zimmerman said.
Her husband, Andrew Koko, added: "It also reflects the way Americans eat."
This pair of couples living in the Brooklyn Highlands are food historians.
Mr. Koch's last book, "Fried Chicken," is about American Chinese food, while Ms Krugman tells the life story of the slum-tenants by food in her 97 orchard.
They co-authored the new book "A sumptuous feast," published by Harper Press on Tuesday, which introduced the history of America's food history during the Great Depression.
After showcasing some food-related insights, they met a reporter in Eisberg's sandwich shop. The simple lunch counter in the ironing area has been open from the time of the 1929 economic meltdown.
The 54-year-old Mr. Krugman ordered a cream cheese for the olive sandwich, while the 57-year-old section ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
The reporter ordered a piece of baked meat, and the couple thought the dishes were suitable for discussing the diet during the Great Depression.
"Bread was very popular at the time," Ms. Zimman said.
There was peanut bread, liver bread, soya bread.
They both use one kind of raw material and a cheap water to feed on the material.
Imagine your dinner is all peanuts.
Mr. Koko pretended to be a freak.
"they must be like lead in your stomach," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the Americans were buffet, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cook meals for male farm workers, and have breakfast, lunch, and dinner have had just the pie.
In World War I, it was the Americans who sent food to the hungry Europeans. The sumptuous feast records how the country suddenly ceases to be a rich place.
Mr. Koko explained why he and his wife wanted to write the book: "At that time, food has become a major topic of unhappiness for Americans."
Another unpleasant topic is new foods such as cold acid: Bread and stews, such as bread and stew, become the main dish, the stew is "the best left dish cooking mode," said Ms Krugman, because the chefs can use the cream in the sauce to cover the difficult food.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap fruits.
The meat, which has been leading the American dining table for years, has become a rare luxury.
A curious jumble of calories only takes into account calories, which is first considered nutrition, compared to taste, even basic culinary common sense.
During the study of this book, including various recipes, Ms. 齐格曼 produced a roast onion stuffed with peanut oil.
"It's not common at the dinner table," Mr. Koko said.
"It's too strange," Ms Zimman said.
Peanut butter is no match with baked onion.
This is the characteristic of many families.
Family economists have influenced the country's eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, the head chef of the Federal Family Economy, 1923-1943, which historically had nothing to do with it.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encourage women to "economize" and try to make poor foods such as butter pasta with carrots and carrots.
The sumptuous feast is a rich "historical treasure."
It is particularly interesting to note the government's response to the hungry people, such as President Herbert Hoover, "I can't handle anything else."
While he openly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse in his childhood, his diet was like a millionaire.
"He likes to eat European Western food, such as fish and cucumber sauce," Mr Koko said.
He wore a evening dress and had dinner in a gilded restaurant.
He was clearly separated from the people.
Had it not been for his wife, Eleanor, who encouraged him to set an example in his diet, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
As the book says, Ms. Roosevelt's housekeeper has no interest in the taste, so the food in the White House is not only the most difficult food in Washington, but also the worst food for cooking. "
When America comes back to formal, many of the Great Depression recipes are discarded.
Ms Krugman says what's left is our attention to calories and nutrition and the application of science to cooking.
When the couple said they were writing the book, they learned more about the eating habits of Ms Krugman's mother, such as how she did not discard food.
"She was very scared to waste food," he said.
"She actually made many people sick," Ms Krugman recalls.
For example, there has been a "cream bubble" incident.
After removing the plates, she and Mr. Koko took out a dessert they were preparing at home: This is the fruit pudding eaten by President Roosevelt in his lunch.
"This is called cream fruit," Ms Krugman said, "and adding that a new trendy name for a common dish is" usual tactics. "
There is no cream in this dessert, and only fruit, flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctant the spoon into the thick brown paste.
Unexpectedly, the sweet taste is not good.
Mr. Koko also ate the second spoonful, the third spoonful.
He thought it was an acceptable price dessert, and told his wife: "Some chopped walnuts will be better."
Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report showed that crude oil production continued to rise in July, with Saudi output reaching a new high.
The report does not ban the credibility of the market on OPEC's credibility, and the road to recovery is likely to be strewn with thorns.
On Monday, the OPEC Chairman-in-Office and Minister for Energy, Qatar, said OPEC would hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on 26-28 September.
The monthly report released by OPEC on Wednesday showed an increase of 4.6 million barrels per day / day to 331.1 million barrels / day in July, including Gabon, in July.
OPEC also stated in its monthly report that the low price of crude oil has prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil products, adding to the extent of the market's excess supply.
Affected by this news, combined with an increase in the volume of crude oil production and the accidental increase in crude oil inventories, the international price of oil fell on two consecutive days.
The price of light crude oil futures dropped 2.48 per cent in September and the London Brent crude oil futures fell 2.07 per cent in October, as of Wednesday's closing.
According to Reuters, the proposed oil-producing countries' meeting is unlikely to tighten the supply, and data released by the United States Agency for Energy Information also depress sentiment.
Iran's official news agency Fars quoted Iran's oil minister on Wednesday saying Iran's crude oil production was at a peak of 385 million barrels a day, the highest since 2008.
On the news of the meeting, Novak, Russia's energy minister, said Russia's energy minister Novak said there was no need for a new round of frostbite negotiations under the current oil price.
The last meeting of the oil-producing countries was already in April, and OPEC members failed to reach agreement on any measure.
'the market and the media are likely to overreact to OPEC meetings, 'says EmmaRichards, an oil and gas analyst at BMIR.
Helima Croft, chief commodity strategist at Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC could change the market sentiment by releasing signals that they would create agreements.
This tool is like a smoke and a mirror that draws people's eyes (deliberately misleading).
'we think OPEC is trying to stabilize the market by September, 'says Eugenia Weinberg, head of commodity research for commercial banks in Germany.
This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, after all the organization has staged a "wolf."
In all parts of the world, medical advertisements, complaint reporting centres, past medical institutions have been repeatedly punished as a spot-test focus.
The National Health and Family Commission, the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, will organize, in due course, the implementation of special supervision and inspection work in some provinces.
According to the media, as a result of the massive influx of capital into Internet medicine, the current product homogenization problem is serious, the investment boom has receded, capital into the wait-and-see.
According to data from the Hong Kong AIDS Hospital Management Research Center, Internet health companies have died a year ago, and about 20 per cent of the start-up Internet health-care companies have ceased to exist.
However, in the case of most of the Internet health companies struggling to finance the A or B, there are several down leading companies that still get capital popular.
It appears that Internet medical entrepreneurship is not "a beehive," but rather to look at the quasi-market demand, and to do it deeply.
Dive contributed $1200.00 million, accounting for 40% of registered capital and $1800.00 million, or 60% of registered capital.
In recent years, with the policy support of the state in medical informatization, the electronic and integrated supply chain management system gradually reaches all levels of hospitals.
The co-operation with Kyushu is precisely aiming at the demand of the market, helping hospitals to build up advanced supply chain management systems and as an opportunity to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many Internet healthcare firms, iBaby has initially focused on the vertical field of Internet obstetrics, digging deep into pregnant mothers and doctors at both ends.
Expectant mothers are not only able to ask for a 24-hour and one-on-on-one day-on-one basis, but also pay for targeted medical consultations.

Stay up and stay up late to watch the Olympic Games prone to damage your heart

In this regard, doctors are particularly reminded that there is a risk of cardiovascular disease that may cause cardiovascular disease to stay up late to watch the health dangers of the event.
If you stay up late for a long time, the hormone will continue to secrete a lot of secretion, the person's experience is continuing to be in a state of intense excitement, can cause vasoconstriction and blood pressure rise, leading to cardiovascular disease.
It is a special reminder that cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, smoking habits, family history and cardiovascular risk factors, such as staying up late, are more likely to trigger cardiovascular disease.
If stay up late, not only cardiovascular function, but also gastric function, immune system, neuroendocrine system will be affected, and even the risk of cancer increases.
For older friends, Han Zhiyuan suggests, try not to stay up late to watch the Olympics, especially those with cardiovascular history.
During the last World Cup football match, Han Zhiyuan visited a 60-year-old patient, whose myocardial infarction was triggered or linked to stay up late to watch the game.
Mr. Han said that this year, his department has received some 25-year-old cardio-infarct or cerebral apoplexy patients, which is largely due to the long-term stay-up of patients.
Do not stay up late every day, occasionally stay up late to watch the favorite sport, and others may wait for the next day to watch the event again.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union threw missiles into Cuba and nearly killed Soviet nuclear war.
The incident was seen as the peak of the Cold War, the history of which called the "Cuban missile crisis."
It is also known, however, that during the Cold War, a strong solar storm had also brought about a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, which was first published by researchers only on 9 August.
On 23 May 1967, a strong solar storm had strongly interfered with the American military's radar and radio communication in the Arctic.
These radars are part of the United States ballistic missile early warning system to monitor Soviet missiles.
The paper, which was completed by researchers at the University of Colorado, interviewed United States military personnel who were involved in forecasting and analysing solar activities, and consulted the literature.
In the 1960 "s, the United States Air Force has always had a part of its fighter jets flying in the sky to prevent a sudden nuclear war in the Soviet Union.
The U.S. Military commander did not know that the main culprit was the solar storm rather than the Soviet Union, and ordered the fighters to enter combat readiness.
Fortunately, the US military has finally stopped this potential military conflict from the solar activity that began in the late 1950s and its research on the electromagnetic interference of Earth.
Later, he summarized the information provided by the Air Force Aviation Department of the United States Air Force and submitted a detailed report.
The direct consequence of the solar storm is the fact that the United States military has since viewed space weather as a operational concern and has established a stronger system for space weather forecasting.

This new service function is quick, economical and administrative cost; second, respecting and protecting the privacy of citizens; third, all-weather and full-time service.
As long as the public has a micro-letter, it can be very convenient to operate on its own, which is relatively easy to "meet" in a friendly and easy way to ease parking problems and reduce the number of security cases in the vehicle involved.
On the other hand, in the case of the refusal of a vehicle, the illegal parking or obstruction of the vehicle owner, the authorities of Xi'an indicated that the police officer would then take different disposal measures, depending on the circumstances, depending on the circumstances.

On 27 April 2015, the United States and Japan jointly issued a new edition of the Sun-day Defense Cooperation pointer in New York allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role globally.
This is the day when U.S. Defense Secretary Carter, US Secretary of State Kerry, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan, the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Japanese Defense Minister were present at a press conference in New York.
This is the fifth time that China's civil think tank has published the Japanese military capability assessment report, and it is the fourth edition of the English version.
The report consists of nine chapters, including general policy adjustments, military strength, defence budget, military deployment, weaponry, institutional development reform, military training, external military security cooperation and military security relations with China.
The report states that 2015 is the year in which Abe's Government has advanced major policy adjustments in the area of security for several years.
Since then, Japan's initiatives in the area of security will focus primarily on the operational dimensions of the use of the rule of law, strategic follow-up, policy implementation and other operational dimensions, not frameworks, mechanisms and policies.

Short Public Sports Facilities
The dark coal-field warehouse turned into a football field of "green grass," the roof of the red brick roof, and turned into a modern sports hall.
At the National Fitness Day, the South Lok Ma Camp Sports Culture Park outside the Wangjiang gate opened the mysterious veil.
It was a coal field and remained idle more than a decade ago, leaving a large amount of illegal construction and waste of life.
After remediation, it became a sports and cultural park and will be officially opened in November to provide free movement to the public free of charge, and there is no doubt that it opens up a new fertile ground for universal sports.
This reminds me of Hangzhou Chen Shun School, the Chinese swims "Huang Po Military Academy" to travel more than the world champion.
The famous swimming pool will flow continuously and vividly illustrates the relationship between athletic sports and popular sports - the rich people's foundation provides good conditions for the selection of professional players.
The level of athletic sports is closely related to the foundation of popular sport, which depends on the sport of all people, which depends on the condition of the stadium.
As of 2015, China's per capita sporting space has been reported to have been 150 times the size of the new China, but still lags far behind the sports power.
In June this year, the State Council issued a National Fitness Plan (2016-2020) to focus on the development of mass sports.
In order to fill this short plate, the relevant departments should take full account of the layout of sports venues in the planning of urban planning.
On the other hand, the established public sports venues, including sports venues in establishments such as schools, should maximize the scope of openness and maximize efficiency.
The Olympic Games, which are now in full swing, inspire the enthusiasm of people and arouse the awareness of everyone.

The Clinton couple earned 34.2% of the federal tax by paying $10.75 million in 2015
Hillary Clinton released its 2105 tax return on Friday, which showed the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had an income of $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% federal taxes.
In 2015, the Clinton couple received $1 million in charitable contributions, most of which contributed nearly $5.3 million to the Clinton Foundation, while former Secretary of State Bill Clinton earned $3 million from the publisher's book on her tenure in the State Council.
Clinton's campaign partner, Senator Tim Kane of the Federal State of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, announced a 10-year tax return declaration.
The two men paid 20.3 per cent of the federal tax in 2015.
Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane, Clinton's campaign assistant, said in a statement: "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane will continue to be financial transparency."
In stark contrast to this, Donald Trump masks false reasons and retracted his commitment to the disclosure of the tax returns made before him.
Although the law does not require, the United States presidential candidates should disclose their tax returns, in accordance with established practice.
As a New York businessman, Trump, as well as his lawyers, have used the audit of the IRS as a reason for refusing to disclose the tax returns.
Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sames, said he was quoted by you as a host and attached to the tax declaration of Democratic candidates.
On Thursday, Trump's special advisor, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release tax returns until the audit was completed.
Critics of Trump, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans in 2012, say Trump's refusal to publish the tax returns would raise questions about its net worth, philanthropy, business deals, and other relationships, including its relationship with Russia.
Clinton grabbed the issue and slammed into a cyber video on Friday, highlighting high-profile Democrats urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, she raised the issue in the state of Michigan's economic policy speech.
She said to the crowd: "For decades, he refuses to publish his tax declaration as other presidential candidates."
Trump's business columnist quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants over two years in the 1990 "s, according to the News, which quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, saying the current situation is likely to be the case.
The federal tax has become a major problem in the presidential campaign.
Clinton named the US $10 million investment home, Warren Buffett, named a provision guaranteeing at least 30% of the tax paid by people who earn more than $1 million.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, Nebraska, where Buffett called for Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Mr Buffett said he was also under an IRS audit and Mr Trump was "scared" not of the tax authorities, but of the electorate.
The first tax declaration announced by the Clinton campaign team was 2007.
The average federal tax rate for the Clinton couple, who currently reside in New York, has reached about 32 per cent of the average federal tax rate between 2007 and 2014, with an aggregate tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton couple's 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, they earn only $100.
Their major investments are a low-cost index common fund, and the Clinton couple's dividends and interest income are US $109,000.

Jewish filmmakers criticize the Berlin Hotel to delete the Israeli telephone code in line with the "request" of Arab customers, Reuters News
A French filmmaker with Jewish origin revealed to the media that the Kinesky hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's telephone code, and the hotel staff indicated that it was a "demand" of Arab customers, which triggered public opinion.
Claude 朗兹曼, author of the Holocaust documentary , expressed his disappointment at the Kempinski Hotel and published an open letter in the German Report.
During a recent stay, Longman wanted to find Israel on a list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
But Israel is not among the countries where guests can speak directly from the room.
Did Israel disappear in the German capital, Berlin, in 2016?
"You know," said Langman.
Instead, guests can call the Israeli telephone at the call center at the Kebsky Hotel.
In search of the explanation, the film producer asked the hotel front desk.
In his letter, Langzman said he was shocked by the reply he had received at the front desk.
The hotel staff said it was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Cabinda Hotel."
The reason to do this is to make the film producer angry.
Langzman quoted the employee's original message: Most of our guests were Arabs and asked to delete Israel's code. "
According to the Nande Daily News, the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov 哈达斯, called this "humiliation."
We were surprised to learn of the incident.
This is a great shame in itself.
In Germany and the chain of hotels, it was a disgrace.
There is no explanation for this matter.
"We hope the hotel can draw the right conclusion," said the official.
The incident sparked heated debate on the Internet, and everyone thought it was a scandal.
It has been argued that Cabinda Hotel is simply a "servile" to meet the demands of Arab customers.
Another post pointed to the "really" of the hotel and pointed out that the main street in the famous 库达姆 Street was near a Jewish synagogue.
The hotel quickly clarified all allegations, according to the Mirror Weekly, claiming that everything was "negligent" and "apologetic" to rantz.
The Rio daily quoted the Kempinski representative as saying: "There has never been a direct order to remove Israel from the fast-dial list."
The paper also says the Israeli code is added to the list.
Brazilian students protesting against the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by the police
On Thursday, in São Paulo, Brazil, students clashed with the police during a protest against the reform of the government's public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesters.
The incident was triggered by attempts by law enforcement officials to disperse students, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Hundreds of students took part in the march and expressed their dissatisfaction with the programmes.
In order to save money, the Governor of São Paulo, Ok Ok, plans to close 100 public schools and 300,000 students will be transferred to school.
Some students who took part in the protests voiced their dissatisfaction with the temporary president, Michel Tesla, through graffiti on the wall.
Just a few days before the recent protests, protesters marched on the streets to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the National Senate.
Scottish cyclist Carl Skinner won the gold medal after winning the gold medal
The Scottish cyclist Carl Skinner helped the British trio win the Olympic gold medal after the 2012 London Olympic Games last night.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist replaced his Scottish compatriot, Sir Chris Hawk, and became the backbone of the team. When young Skinner defeated the winning New Zealand team and returned home, the legendary cyclist was proud of him.
Four years ago, the British team was amazed, and Hoy won the fifth of the six Olympic gold medals.
The British team was only sixth in the world cycling tournament in London in March, and Hoai had since retired. Then the British team was re-created.
During the Beijing Olympics to the London Games, the British team's question was to change the "first circle expert," Jamie Staff.
The convoy was just doing that in Slyle's presence.
Hoy's retirement also left a blank, while Chien Isma and Matt Cranton wanted to fill the gap.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the British men's training team insisted on allowing him to be included in the national team, and Skinner eventually had to live up to expectations.
Skinner's partner was the winner of the gold medal four years ago with Hoy and Kenny. The trio refreshed the Olympic records in the qualifying match, but that performance was overtaken by the New Zealand team in the first round.
The three British cyclists eventually beat their opponents and won gold medals.
Though Snyder was slightly behind, Kenny was leading the team, and Skinner kept the leading edge in the end.
The change in strategy is the key to this reversal, and Sates chose a larger flywheel, so slower, and that would allow Kenny, especially Skinner, to keep pace.
Howie watched on as a BBC commentator, with Callum Skinner, Kenny and Sims seeing him as they made their way to the podium.
"The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist Skinner said," It makes me feel flattered. "
I just do what I can to make myself a million.
We created the Olympic records and defeated the world champion in the final.
It's incredible.
Nothing is better than this victory.
After winning the gold medal with Kenny and Hoy at the 2012 London Games, Sades admitted that he had deliberately fallen off the track when he started off.
He later withdrew the comment, and the British rivals were unable to appeal.
There is no such thing as this victory.
"It's like in London, it's the British flag on the platform," he said.
We just got teams just three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world championships, so it's amazing to be able to defend the Olympic champion.
This is just a game and a gold medal for the British team that won 10 of the gold medals at the Beijing Olympics and the London Games.
If this is emblematic of the progress we have made in the last five months, we will continue to be successful in the bicycle pavilion for the next five days.
According to Kenny's state of state, he was not able to reproduce the feat of winning three gold medals at an Olympic Games.
If so, Bihiro's young 12-year-old and also on March 23 (this day seems to be a sacred day for the British sports community, and Kenneth Radef, Mora Farra and Roger Bennett) were born to have six gold medals and one silver medal.
This achievement is at the same level as Hoy.
Kenny next will be fighting for a three-day race today.
"I'm going to concentrate on the game," said the 28-year-old Bolton.
Team games have always been the best.
You can win the game with your teammates.
Frankly speaking, a man wins a little lonely.
"If he wins two other gold medals, he should be awarded a knighthood, "he said.
It was the only game that had won medals in the same day, but the British team received other good news.
Sir BRADLEY Wijins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Dursley were in pursuit of a four-kilometre group with the fastest possible score.
Their achievements were 351.943.
The world record for the 2012 London Olympic gold medal winner was 351.659.
The first round and the final (at 10: 42 pm) will be held today (at 10.42 pm), and Wilkins will undoubtedly be the focus of all attention.
Yesterday he had an argument with the competition officer prior to the qualifying match yesterday, when the competition officer asked him to measure his height.
In the women's team, which will end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rotherford, Eleanor Bacon, and Kate Agbode, from Millid, have made a new world record of 413.260.
The British team relied on a strong team of its venues for the mid-term occupancy of the Olympic Games and awarded more than a medal.
After showing the absolute rule of dominance in Beijing and London, Britain's self-propelled motorcade made a sense of disappointment in the course of the trip to Rio.
Many twists and turns have taken place during the period, including the resignation of Sean Senton, director of the April Technical Director, who resigned as a result of gender discrimination and bullying, as well as the retirement of legendary figures such as Hoy, Victoria Pendleton.
But the first game night of the bike museum is enough to prove that the British team will come back to the legend of its peak at a critical moment.
After a little life comes to this world, parents are responsible for this life, not only in the health of the child, but also in spiritual development, and education.

The original title: 2,000 chicken farms in Jiangsu Province were sold to the court by the court to seize the sentence without authorization
After the judgment entered into force, the king applied for enforcement to the Shu Yang court due to the fact that Li did not meet the duty to determine the judgment automatically.

The head of the Industrial Coordination Division of the National Development Reform Commission said today that overcapacity is a global problem.
Our capacity utilization rate in recent years has been above the global average and higher than in countries and regions, such as the US and Europe.
Our country has taken firm and effective measures to resolve excess capacity, and its effectiveness is gradually becoming apparent.
The director noted that the State Council of the Central Committee attached great importance to the global problem of overcapacity.
Departments and regions actively follow up on the deployment of the State Council and carry out their work seriously, with less than 45 million tons of rough steel capacity this year.
From our national circumstances, our country does not encourage the export of steel, on the contrary, we have taken a series of practical measures to control the export of steel.
The leader stressed that the international trade in steel products was essentially market-based behaviour and was the autonomous option that arose from the demand of importing countries and the combination of consumer considerations into consideration of the value for money.
The implementation of trade protection measures does not contribute to a fundamental solution to the development problems of the global steel industry and, on the contrary, will only lead to further shocks to the international trading order.
In addressing debt, the head of the group stressed that the solution to the debt problem was an important issue that needed to be properly addressed in the process of defusing excess capacity.
Owing to the size and breadth of the steel enterprises' assets, the debt relationship between some enterprises is complex and, if improperly disposed of, may lead to regional risks.
According to the director, in recent years, as the economic downward pressure has increased, the total demand of society has gradually diminished, and some industries have decreased capacity utilization, and the enterprise production and business difficulties increase.
Some enterprises do not adapt to changes in the market environment, and production operations are unsustainable even on the verge of collapse, but are constrained by institutional mechanisms and become "zombie enterprises."
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces the efficiency of the utilization of factor resources, increases the cost of social management and hinders the establishment of a fair competition market environment.
The main reasons for the losses are the same as those faced by the global steel industry - low market demand and low capacity utilization.
In our country mainly adopts market mechanism, economic instruments and rule of law approach, and the government is mainly responsible for the economic and social stability of workers, guaranteeing fair and fair market order.
The leader stressed that the next step would be to remain steadfast in its capacity to work in order to ensure that the target tasks of 100 million tons of rough steel capacity to 150 million tons of rough steel capacity were completed in five years.

Moscow tourist police officers patrol the Red Square, Nico Lipsky Walk, Gulen department store, and so on, with Chinese tourist police learning together, and the entire process lasted more than an hour.
She was in her 20s, fluent in English and Spanish, and she joined the tourist police force last year.
He looked at the Russian colleague's line of words along the way and interacted with her from time to time.
When the Spanish tourists came to consult, the Moscow travel police gave the other a patient explanation in fluent Spanish, which impressed Wang ice.
"Every man in the Moscow tourist police holds a foreign language, and there will be more than two or more people, which is very big for us."
As Hainan as an international tourist island, Hainan is gradually paying attention to attracting international tourists, and we want to improve our ability to match the status of international tourism. "
The Chinese tourism police also exchanged views with their Russian counterparts in the city of Moskov, a tour of the Moscow Tourism Police Brigade, prior to the same day of study.
"I often deal with Chinese tourists and see that they are very happy to come to Russia."
"The question they usually ask is: How can the road go, where is a monument, how to rent, how to get back to the hotel."
Moscow's urban environment and tourism climate have become more and more attractive in recent years, and the attractiveness of foreign tourists is increasing, said the Moscow Tourist Police Force Commander.
To meet the needs of tourism development, a tourist police force was set up in July 2014 to patrol major attractions to help and channel tourists.
At present, all Moscow tourist police are proficient in English, partly in Spanish and German.
According to the level of foreign language, the Police Brigade divided them into nine groups, with two lessons per week to learn to defend themselves, laws and regulations and foreign languages.
"There are now two tourist police officers who are starting to learn Chinese, and we have to continue to improve their Chinese level," Mr. Rensacf said.
He told reporters that the Moscow tourist police had gained some experience since the formation of the Moscow tourist police and hoped to be inspired by anya's peers.
In his view, the cooperation of the police in Russia and the Russian Federation would enhance the security of their citizens to the country's country.
"The visitors to the Moscow tourist police, the police model, the equipping of the police, and good interaction with tourists brought us a lot of inspiration," Chen Xiaobo said.
At least nine provinces and cities such as Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian, Beijing and other provinces have introduced rules for the implementation of residence permits.
With regard to the conditions for the application of a residence permit, the above-mentioned areas have generally been raised for more than half a year and are eligible for legally stable employment, legal stability and continuing education.
It noted that in terms of the treatment provided by the residence permit, the "gold volume" varies from country to country, and the scope of public services and facilities offered in some areas has expanded in comparison with the national version.
These areas have all added to the ease with which children can participate in the local college entrance examination under the relevant conditions.
In addition, Beijing, such as Beijing, has also explicitly called for the gradual expansion of the provision of public services and facilities, and to publish it regularly to the society.
In Fujian, for example, it submits that at least every three years the social services and facilities accessible to the holder of a residence permit are published.
The temporary regulations on residence permit stipulates that if the conditions for processing a residence permit are met, the public security organ shall, within 15 days from the date of receipt, produce a permit for the issuance of a residence permit.
With regard to the time limits for the issuance of the license, the majority of the regions are in agreement with the national version, which is issued within 15 days.
In Hebei, it is clear that a residence permit shall be issued within three working days from the day after the date of the receipt of the application for a residence permit in accordance with the conditions of application and the full range of materials.
Jiangxi stipulates that the public security organ shall, within five working days from the date of admissibility, produce a residence permit within five working days from the date of admissibility.
In accordance with the Temporary Regulations on Residence Permit, the above-mentioned areas are clear for the first time to apply for a residence permit, free from the receipt of documents.
In Sichuan, for example, local police stations or commissioned community service agencies strictly enforce the approved fees and fee rates strictly and strictly prohibit ultra-range, ultra-standard charges or hitchhike fees.
It was found that, on 27 July 2016, the former Ganzhou county party secretary, Chen 阳霞, reported to the office of 省纪委 to work as Director (Deputy Director, for a period of one year).
The red wine that was consumed that night was provided by the Levine personally, and the other costs were borne by a certain individual Liu.
"Chen Yang Xia, Cheng Zi Liang, etc., reported that Chen Yang Xia, Cheng Zi Liang and others were organized and accepted by private organizations, in violation of the central eight regulations, in violation of the Party's discipline.
博格巴 had two yellow cards in the Italia season last season, and it would automatically be suspended according to the rules.
Although he has moved back to the Premier League, the FA has extended its cumulative ban to the Premier League.
In this way, in the match against Bernstein on Aug. 14, Borg Borg will be on the wall and he will return to Manchester United's debut for 20 days with Southampton's home game.
Surrey, as the first 12-round debut in 2014, will be officially landing in the NBA next season, with an alliance of 76 men.
Surrey is a young European player and many fans are not well aware of him, but through this Olympics, Surrey is deeply impressed by Surrey's performance.
The last time in Croatia's game against Spain, Surrey had successfully sealed Paul-Gasol's attempt to drag the race into an extra basket at the end of the game.
Recently, 76 Lakers boss Brett Brown gave Surrey a very high evaluation, and the Spurs manager thought he had seen the shadow of the young Maru-Giano in Surrey.
Obviously, Surrey has demonstrated his talent and made 76 people look forward to him.
In the first two games in Croatia at the current Olympics, Surrey had a total of 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 support.
In the first half, Surrey showed his ability to pull the space off the pitch and hit his shots outside the three-point line after he broke down with his teammates.
Although the 76 people now hoard a lot of talented young players, they don't have Surrey's outside capacity.
From the top of the cap to the start of a long-run counter-attack and finish the help, the NBA players can do this in a handful of players.
Since the beginning of the Olympics, Saric averaged 13 points, 8 rebounds and five assists in three games.
Since the decision to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014, James has signed two successive 1 + 1 contracts.
As the NBA's current labor agreement is about to enter the last year, James will be at the forefront of the labour negotiations as the Deputy of the NBA.
In view of the huge increase in coalition revenues, it would like to thank the new television broadcasting agreement, as well as the fight between the boss and the players on how to deal with the money, and the world fears that the NBA will fall into a standstill next summer.
But for James, he doesn't have to worry about being a free player next summer because he has signed a three-year contract with the Cavaliers.
James was in the contract, regardless of when the 2017-18 season was officially launched.
After the iPhone SE debut, the mobile phone market also ushered in a craze for a small screen.
Shortly before, Nubian has also launched its Z11 series of its first works: Nubi Z11mini.
Nubi Z11mini runs its consistently excellent photo gene, with a single hand more easy to grip the 5.0-inch screen, easy-to-use back fingerprint identification, and achievement of its outstanding usage experience.
Nubia's just-listed small-screen photo-taking cell Z11mini cuts 200 yuan, from the original 1,499 yuan to 1299 yuan.
In terms of appearance, nubi Z11mini uses a 5-inch screen of 1080p screens, and is still the classic "Little Red Circle" design.
The middle box is the metal material, the bottom adopts symmetric design and configuration Type-C data interface.
The future of Portland smelter is fraught with uncertainty over the cancellation of power supply contracts
Due to the fact that a factory owner has revealed that a factory owner will terminate a supply contract to render all supply contracts ineffective, hundreds of workers in Portland, Portland, and factories are currently facing uncertainty about the future.
The initiative took place following the decision of the Victorian Government not to continue issuing subsidies to ensure the operation of the plant.
The fixed-term subsidy for 20 years will be terminated in November.
The 2,000 workers in Portland, the U. S. company, may face unemployment.
As soon as the factory closes, up to 2,000 people may be directly or indirectly unemployed.
And since the factory's electricity consumption accounts for about 10% of Victoria's total electricity output, it could also have a chain reaction.
In 2014, Aluminum Aluminum Company closed the Hanley smelter, which led to the closure of the power plant in Guernsey last year.
The Portland smelter is currently losing its losses and is facing closure risks.
The move was made after a forecast of the plant's coming years, initially owing to the strength of the Australian dollar, most recently because of the price of factory products.
AGL supplies electrical energy to the large aluminium smelter through the Old Elite Power Plant at the Loeb Valley Valley in Montserrat, and the company predicts that three other plant owners will also terminate their agreement.
The biggest shareholder in the factory is a joint venture company with aluminium companies and alumina companies, while China's Sinopec Group and Japan's Poblong Co. Ltd also hold a small share of shares.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, that is, the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand," the joint venture said.
AGL said the contracts were "hedging contracts" that should have been in effect since November 2016.
The termination of the contract period is 12 months, so they will be terminated in 2017.
"As a result, AGL expects that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in the fiscal year 2017," the company said.
Any income effect on AGL from fiscal year 2018 has now been influenced by the optimistic outlook of the futures market for the wholesale price of electricity.
The AGL stated that the company had reduced its contract value of $1.87 million in the "expectation of termination activities."
It said the decision to terminate these contracts "would not affect the ability of Al-aluminium companies to run the smelter or to guarantee the power supply of the smelter."
The United States company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Lao Yang in 2010, which would have entered into force in November this year, but the company did not explain why it had withdrawn from it.
Analysts are cautious about the closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria, as well as the Tobaggo factory near Newcastle, because of the bad economic situation in the industry.
According to the comments made earlier this week, analyst Steven Mikel, managing director of AGL Operations, said that Portland reached about 600 MW of electricity every year, and the Tobaggo factory reached about 900 MW.
If the two factories are closed, the demand for the electricity market will be greatly reduced.
"It's not a good news for us as a power company," he said.
The Community Legal Centres shut down 160,000 people per year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups have been shut out of the community legal centres each year, and the funding of this service is already stretched, and further financial cuts are now being faced.
In Queensland, three out of every five people were denied access to free legal advice and agency services, most of whom were elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who did not have the resources to combat unjust expulsions.
The lack of funding for community legal services has already exceeded the limit and is now facing further funding cuts.
The federal Government's funding for these legal centres will be reduced by 30 per cent since June next year.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Law Center, said thousands of people were excluded every year, according to the latest national community association law centre.
Mr. Farrell said the situation would only be worse if the Federal Government did not change the existing decision.
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning that thousands of people will not be able to get the vital services they need," he said.
Those who need to stay away from violence, those who are burdened with large debts that cannot be repaid, families facing segregation and battered workers are faced with legal aspects, and the report shows that they are not able to obtain the help they need.
The federal government will cut a further 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable groups in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Queensland Member of Queensland, George Brandeis, to immediately withdraw the decision to reduce the funds, so that people can get the help they need in the face of legal issues.
Last year, the state promised to raise legal aid funds to the national average.
It is now important to focus on the needs of community legal centres and their counterparts, as well as the need to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was prosecuted for staff pulling guns
New YORK - Trump's campaign team was indicted for not being charged as a staff member after driving a jeep in February in a jeep in North Carolina.
Vincent Bodini, a former software trainer from the state campaign team, described the incident on Wednesday at the state court in Charlotte.
Mr Bodini said he hoped the matter would be resolved internally, but he was waiting for months to realize that "this is not possible."
According to Bodini's description, the leader named Earl Philip pulled out a pistol, put his right forefinger on the board and directed the gun at Vincent's knee.
After complaining to local and regional campaign team leadership, Bodini learned from the file that at least four other people had experienced the same thing.
Bodini said in his complaint: "No one who has shot does not cause harm."
Just two days before the case took place, the Republican presidential candidate told the public in North Carolina that if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and chosen her favorite judge, then "support the second amendment," it was also that gun holders and firearms enthusiasts might take action.
Trump's campaign team said the media did not advocate violence, and he did not advocate violence, according to Trump's campaign team.
Bodini, in his complaint, called on the campaign team to compensate for his negligence, and requested Philip to compensate for his attacks, beatings and moral injury.
Donald Hicks, Trump's spokesman, did not respond immediately to the news.
Unable to reach Philip.
According to a news agency WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotte, Philip left the campaign team in the near future.
His consulting firm, Innovant Consulting Services, did not respond immediately to calls.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign team has been controversial.
In the present case, the parties contested the election of Bodini with Trump's presidential campaign, 16-CS-14300, Mecklenburg County (Charlotte) High Court.
Britain must pass Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our community, London and the nation as a whole.
As far as I am concerned, this is the charm of Heathrow, as we do our utmost to ensure that our countries and regions will benefit from these events at the 2012 London Games.
The Olympics benefited Stratford and the East.
And we will create opportunities for the benefit of the region by creating opportunities for local populations and businesses near Heathrow.
In terms of our local community alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and lift young people around the airport out of unemployment.
Some people think Heathrow's expansion is too big before the 2012 London Olympics.
I am told that Britain will be unable to prepare for the Olympics, and we will lose face in front of the world.
The skeptics were wrong about the question of the 2012 Olympics, and their suspicions about the Heathrow project would also prove wrong.
While there are always going to be obstacles to overcome, Heathrow is addressing every issue that has been faced.
As the Olympic Games, Heathrow is the infrastructure project for most people and not a few people.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs, bring about 2110 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a technology and employment wealth around the airport and across Britain.
We have an excellent team of Heathrow projects, and the team has completed a billion-pound infrastructure investment project on time and within the budget, including the T5 terminal for five consecutive years' election to the global best airport terminal and the T2 Terminal between the busiest two runways in the world.
Now they are ready to build a third runway at a private investment of Pound1.6 billion.
The United Kingdom successfully held the 2012 London Games, and I believe that the expansion of Heathrow airport will also be a great success.
Now it is time for us to pass the Olympic spirit and expand the Heathrow airport so that we can sail for our future and create a wealth of technology and employment that makes Britain proud.
Lord Paul Danton is the chairman of Heathrow Airport Board and the former British Treasury Secretary of Finance
A woman committed suicide and was run over on the Swiss highway
The victim lay on the highway at midnight.
The woman who tried to commit suicide had been knocked over on the highway in the early morning of Thursday, and the police were looking for witnesses.
The accident happened on the A1 highway near Mordecor, Warzhou, on Thursday.
The Warzhou police said a woman was lying on the road in "desperate" late at night and had been knocked over by a lot of cars.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman whose behaviour was apparently suicidal. She was tossed over by multiple cars, including a van.
The woman died on the spot.
The police have revealed that many of the drivers involved have accepted the investigation, but some of the drivers have not yet confirmed that the police are calling on them and witnesses of the accident to come to an investigation.
According to the Geneva Tribune, the lawyer, Gilles hoff Steiner, stated that a criminal investigation had begun, which was the usual procedure for such incidents.
But it is not yet known whether there will be a driver facing charges.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
"This will be determined by the prosecutor," he said.
Depending on the results of the two other similar cases in the past five years, the driver will not be held accountable.
It was reported that both cases were caused by the fact that people were on the highway late at night. The final verdict was that the pilot could not expect a pedestrian to cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was accused of being responsible for the death of a man as a result of negligence, and the allegation was that in August 2014, she struck a man on a A1 highway near Pasadne and died.
The court was told that the 22-year-old victim crossed the road after drinking.
The judge, after the investigation, said the policewoman was perfectly legitimate at the time, while the man appeared on the highway "completely unexpected and unpredictable," and the policewoman dialed the first aid phone afterwards.
Any person who could provide information on the accident near Mordecor on Thursday should be contacted by a person who contacted the police from 0216 448346 or 0216 444444.
NASA weather model: Venus is fit for human habitation
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus is fit for human habitation.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Research have developed a model that explores the past of Venus, and the tools and algorithms used are very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was used to determine whether the surface temperature, water-free, and the atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide were once similar to the Earth's environment.
Previously, scientists believed that Venus's rotation speed was slower because of its thicker atmosphere.
But the latest simulations suggest that Venus might have had a thin, similar atmosphere similar to the Earth's atmosphere, and then the rotation speed was as slow as it was.
The model also shows the early terrain of Venus.
The dry areas of Venus may be much more dry than the earth, but there are plenty of water and geographic changes to breed life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early in the early days, the glow of sunlight on Venus is 30% darker than the earth.
In a model simulation of the Goddard Space Research Institute, the Goddard Space Research Institute, Anthony Del Pieño, explained: "In the model simulation of the Goddard Space Research Institute, the slow rotation of Venus has lasted for almost two months on its side."
This makes the surface warming and produces a thick cloud of rain, thick clouds like an umbrella blocking most of the sun's heat.
The simulation results show that the average temperature of Venus is actually a bit lower than the current Earth.
The evolution of Venus in this model is similar to that of previous planetary scientists.
Although Venus may have lived on Venus, Venus has been exposed to high temperatures and ultraviolet rays for billions of years.
The ocean on the planet evaporates, and water vapor is burned by ultraviolet light.
With the escape of hydrogen, there is only a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse gas effect, thus forming the Venus we know today.
The researchers published the simulation results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research.
Patrick Roy to step down as avalanche squad manager
Patrick Lo, who resigned from the Colorado Springs ice hockey team manager and vice-president on Thursday, said he had no say in the decision-making level of the team.
Joe Sachs, managing director of Colorado's executive vice president, confirmed the news and said the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"Over the last three years, in the last three years, I have lived with vigour, passion and determination to fulfill the responsibilities of the head of the Colorado avalanche manager and vice-president in the past three years," Ron said in a statement.
Throughout the summer, I thought about how to improve the team and make it more powerful than ever.
To that end, the goal of the manager and vice president is to be consistent with the goals of the club.
He also needs to have a say in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
At present, however, these conditions have not been met.
萨奇斯 hired Roy on 23 May 2013, and he thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick said," Patrick told me his decision today. "
We express our gratitude to him for his contribution to the club and hope that he will be working in the future.
Rod was nominated as the best coach of the Jack Adams Award in the first season of the avalanche team in 2013-14.
He helped the club get 112 points, the first in the middle part, but the Colorado team was phased out by the Minnesota team in the first round of the playoffs and lost their hand in the playoffs last couple of years.
In the 2015/16 season, the Avalanche had a 39-39-4 record and lost the second wild card for the western Grand league division by a margin of 5.
As the goalkeeper, Rowe won four Stanley cups and won two for the effects of the Montreal Canadian team and avalanche team.
Workers of the North Sea oil fields stopped their strike and continued negotiations
The chief negotiator said workers in the North Sea oil field stopped the pay strike and the parties to the dispute began a new round of negotiations.
The North Sea Oil Platform, operated by Royal Shell of the Netherlands, appeared on a number of strikes directed at Wood Group, an oil field service company.
According to a joint statement, "Wood Group and Treaties and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute."
We will begin a multi-day meeting in the coming weeks to revisit these issues, starting earlier next week.
The union said its recent action was to protest at the highest possible rate of 30 per cent reduction, which was the first time that trade unions had taken the initiative for the first time in 25 years.
Wood Group's pay for North Sea contractors has fallen by about 9% this year due to market pressures.
The company reduced the remuneration of offshore contractors by 10 per cent in 2014, prior to this reduction.
The company said it would help the company to survive the depression of the market once more.
Shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down its oil and gas equipment in 10 countries, because the company needs to streamline its operations after the merger with the British Energy Corporation, the British Gas Group.
Energy companies are facing pressure from falling crude oil prices and Brexit decisions in June.
Dave Anderson, a Scottish parliament member, met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labour dispute in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea and the whole country, Dave said in a statement:" We need a economy that serves most people and few people in the North Sea and the whole country. "
In 2016, expenditures for new projects in the North Sea are projected to exceed $1.4 billion, compared with an average project expenditure of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Cape Coller Measurement of the Rotation Speed of the Stars of Anders
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers capture the most complete set of stars on the stars.
The new data are helping astronomers understand why the star's star has a different rotation speed and the connection between the rotation cycle and the planet.
"We want to learn more about the relationship between the mass, age, and even the history of the solar system by comparing our results with other clusters," said Luiza Rebel, a research scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing Analysis at the University of California Polytechnic in Pasadena
It is 445 light years in the Earth from the Earth.
Many of the stars in this group were born around 125 million years ago and are now in adulthood.
They reached the highest rate of self-rotation in their lives.
These mature stars shoot a large number of stellar winds when reaching the highest rotation speed.
When these stars wind through the magnetic field of stars, they will have a braking effect on stars.
As the age of stars increases, the rate of rotation of the stars begins to slow down.
Kepler measured the self-rotation speed of the stars by tracking measurable stars, like sunspots.
The latest self-transmitted velocity data sets show that the self-rotation of larger stars is slower than that of smaller stars.
LeBrdo likens the star to a dancer and a larger dancer gyroomed slower than a smaller dancer.
"We found that the slower-moving stars tend to be larger, and the fastest-moving stars are the lightest stars," Rebel said.
Due to the close proximity of the Pleiades, it can be used as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing the mass and rotation speed of stars.
"The two-way spin theory model for young and elderly stars lay the foundation for the two-way spin-back theory model for young and elderly stars," Rebel said.
We still have a lot of knowledge about how stars, when and why slow down and "pick up their own shoes," still need to be understood.
In three new papers, Rebel and her colleagues describe in detail their latest analysis of the rotation speed of Anders. The three papers will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
Zheng Jianjun, head of the South Lake Park Water Management Section, said it was likely that at least 10 metres deep in the bottom of the lake, it was likely to be dangerous.
"Although the South Lake rescue team is very professional, it is hoped that a large number of tourists will be able to wear a lifejacket, do not make irregular action on the lake, play safe," said Zheng Jianjun.
The enclosure village has a unique environment for the marine environment, sits on the natural and human ecology two major leisure tourism resources.
But the purchase of individual owners of district parking spaces, fearing that doing so would affect their car rental prices, also suspected that others had private hearts, so that they had been damaged, leading to the shelving of the garage. "
The story of the academic community is still very complicated with the question of when the sweet potato is introduced by whomever it is introduced.
In the present more mainstream view, the introduction of sweet potato mainly has three lines.
The three lines introduced by the sweet potato are the most influential and most widely distributed, and Chen Zhenlong is introduced into Fuzhou by the Philippines.
The Office of the social group management of Beijing will carry out special checks on the use of the consolidated receipts of social groups on this day.
The inspection is divided into two kinds of unit self-examination and focus.
Municipal society organizations in charge of the introduction, the scope of this inspection range from 2013 to 2015 in the municipal consortium to run the social group collective income unified receipt of the social group.
"The success of the Olympic Games is defined by people who share stories in social media," Rio BOCOG said in the 2008 Olympic communication strategy.
From the report of the current Olympics, the media have made great changes in modes of transmission, product form, language style, news perspective, and so on.
The IOC and the media practitioners of the world's countries seem to have met the challenge.
On Aug. 11, the Everbright Securities HUnit opened its last day of public sale. It was noted that the two-day market reaction was flat. According to the plan, it would be listed on 18 August at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
According to a domestic brokerage analyst, the Oriental Securities is not good at the port base, and its management is not good, and its management is the head of the bank.
The experts point out that as the stock market returns to a flat rate this year, many brokerage firms have experienced a decline in performance, but it is not possible to generalize about the company's own business development after the company's listing.
After the new deal was introduced, Suzhou will be the first two-line city in the country to restart the limit.
The two cities that have introduced or are about to introduce the policy of regulating the housing market are more than Suzhou, and they include cities such as Hefei and Nanjing.
Previously, Hefei had taken the lead in issuing a limits policy, and banks would refuse to provide mortgage services for home buyers with two sets of housing loans in Hefei.
