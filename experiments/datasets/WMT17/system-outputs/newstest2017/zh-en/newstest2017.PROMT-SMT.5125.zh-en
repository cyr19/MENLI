Junior doctors' strike: New Labour calls for action
The call for junior doctors to approve the Alliance for a new contract to take over the new industrial action.
The British Medical Association junior doctors committee will require all of its members since the beginning of nine months to support more industrial action.
Junior Doctors Committee, said ministers did not address concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted to boycott in July with the British Medical Association to reach a contract deal.
Members of the polled, 58 per cent against the contracts traded.
junior doctor committee chair Ellen McCourt, posted on Twitter late on Thursday in a letter to members, the letter says, the question of a boycott has led to a contract, the government was "always remain silent."
She said: "In light of this, junior doctors committee's Executive Committee had voted overall rejection of the proposed new contract and calls on all concerned to formal consultation."
In response to the government, the silence of the Junior Doctors Committee today on the executive committee has formally submitted a request to the British Medical Association Council held a special session to approve nine months from escalation of industrial action at the beginning of a long-term plan.
The dispute has led to junior doctors were involved in six strikes this year, including the British National Health Service for the first time in the history of the general strike.
The British Medical Association junior doctor leader Dr Johann Malawana in the British Medical Association has recommended contract terms have been agreed to resign after referendum boycott.
The 54,000 junior doctors and medical students voted before the meeting, he was a member of the British Medical Association, said the deal is good, and therefore should be accepted.
Following the vote, the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt said the contract will be in the England medical staff to enforce.
Russia and Turkey: "antipathetic Union"?
a gesture to put an end to a crisis.
The Russian and Turkish leaders meet on Tuesday, the two sides announced a formal end to shake hands and up to eight months of rhetoric and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin, in a St. Petersburg golden palace to meet in the lobby of the Turkish president, I have a strong feeling: This reconciliation is Ankara's most want to see.
Yes, indeed, both sides shook hands.
However, even as Mr. Putin has always reserved standards, Mr Putin is just shallow smiles, almost did not exude fervor.
According to reports, Recep Tayyip Erdogan is five times referred to a "good friend" Putin.
I don't remember.
At the same time, he promised to relations with Russia will return to levels before the crisis, and even reached a higher level.
The next day, when a newspaper wrote that Mr Erdogan would act like that had ever happened.
But I think his passion hint at some of the stuff.
However, Mr Putin continued apathetic attitude that suggests he is not forgotten.
In fact, he mentioned in his opening remarks, the first thing this time is the cause of the crisis: Syrian border in Turkey shot down a Russian fighter aircraft.
Moscow's reaction was very intense.
Mr. Putin, in response to the incident, accusing Ankara savaged in the back to Moscow.
attacks from so-called friends are much harder to accept.
Both sides are very difficult, even impossible, to recreate the real confidence.
Since the start of November, the Russian public opinion has been reversed.
For months, the media is controlled by the government in Ankara has been shocking to attack.
All of a sudden, the Turks seem to want responsibility for everything.
Of these, the most serious came from senior officials accused of: Mr Erdogan's family from the so-called Islamic State in Syria under the control of the illicit oil trading profit.
He has categorically denied the claim.
However, the news from St. Petersburg shows, it is time to move on.
After all this time on the premise that Putin met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has received an apology.
Russia could declare victory.
For Ankara, the truce for benefit is obvious.
First, put Mr Erdogan last month after a failed coup nearly ousted, so he will need all the support of friends.
Constant terror attacks has clearly caused him considerable fight.
There are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions against Turkey on a large, particularly the prohibition would transport every year millions of Russian tourists to Turkey coast charter services.
That number has tumbled nearly 90 per cent.
With the resumption of flights, Russian tour operators and charter companies will breathe a sigh of relief.
They will come to an end the Mediterranean tourism boom.
Even on national television this week predicted that once the Turkish agricultural imports, to let go of the fruit and vegetable prices will decline.
one Moscow newspaper Vedra MOSTI reported: "Tourists go, tomato back."
For the visit to Moscow, it also has an additional political value.
Ankara intent to take over the Western world's weak response was anger.
In addition, Ankara's accession to the EU for the slow progress of negotiations and Vladimir Putin's hand in frustration over a long period of time, Mr Putin is keen to use political chill, and to weaken the relationship between Turkey and the Western world.
As a result of the election authorities to embrace after the failed coup, the Russian leader will receive credit for Ankara.
Note that this has been for regime change in Moscow have deep-seated fear is a gift.
So, on this golden seaside palace to meet held by Russia and Turkey are two Western world state in denial and abuse ally, one analyst describes it as "like a fish out of water union."
However, despite public reconciliation, but there are still significant differences between the two sides.
Syria is a key factor. Moscow has played the role of peacemaker in Syria, while Russia and Turkey, but support for the opposing factions.
The foreseeable that, after nearly three hours of preliminary talks, the two presidents said at the press conference, has yet to talk about that subject.
Turkish president avoided questions about the differences between the parties, and Putin is highlighted.
Both sides on how to find common ground on Syria is not a clear consensus.
Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Turkey shot down Russian warplanes brought about by the months of open hostilities and raised the possibility of large-scale disasters, the two leaders to resume dialogue again is definitely a good thing.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be outside Scotland for customer service
According to Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive revealed that banks would be reduced to a logistics sector.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be for customers outside of Scotland service.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland division, Royal Bank of Scotland brand has committed to its global ambitions.
But eight years ago, on the verge of collapse and had to accept help from then on she gave up that kind of pursuit.
During that time, a brand strategist, using "RBS" to protect other consumer financial brand.
Group had spent millions of pounds in sponsorship of Six Nations rugby match and cool, a tennis champion Andy Murray sponsorship of international sporting events.
But now, the right approach was to make it more of a national brand coming to the forefront.
Royal Bank of Scotland customers will be used for Scotland, but won't be able to respond as they are.
In England and Wales, all outside the headquarters and stock exchange will change the reference to the National Westminster Bank.
Ulster Bank has been used for brand of the Autonomous Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland customers.
There are also some other, more prominent smaller private banks Gu Zi brands, such as banks, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwen was at Inverness County customer and employee visited the Tour in an interview.
He told BBC Scotland division, said: "The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our investors brand, as well as staff employed brand one, because there is a wider sense we have become a large brand Bank."
As the bank itself has become an international brand, RBS has become a global brand.
Currently, I'm saying is that we no longer focus on global, we have turned their sights to itself.
Each brand to represent their respective industry is different, and our employees through different brand for customer service.
Royal Bank of Scotland has suggested it would not continue to sponsor six national championships; At the same time, there have been efforts to improve different brands in sports sponsorship image.
The chief executive said: "It is time to become a more brand Bank at the time, because in private, we have been exploring how to become a better service to the customer's bank."
Three years ago if we aspire to be one of the many brands owned by the big banks will be ridiculed.
Now we focus on customer needs, and I'm sure you have noticed the change.
I think we can reboot the brand, but it's a good fit.

This is not a big club, it's not the Royal Ascot race (Royal Ascot), it is only with an average of 20,000 spectators on Friday night.

He probably won't do for too long - a figure RB had previously said that he hoped to be allowed to race at least 50 years ago.
Russian President Vladimir Putin lifted his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin (Vladimir Putin) unexpectedly lifted the Sergei Ivanov (Sergei Ivanov) presidential chief of staff position.
Over the years, Mr. Ivanov, Mr Putin has been at the heart of trust by a group of terrorists.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old today, has been appointed as special representative for environment and transport.
According to a statement from the Kremlin, Mr Putin had "declared the Ivanov, director of The Office of the president of Russia, a position," but did not give a reason.
Mr. Ivanov in 2012 was appointed deputy Anton WA Yinuo (Anton Vaino) has been appointed as his successor.
Mr. WA Yinuo aged 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in 1972 in Estonian capital Tallinn, a graduate of the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO), the embassy in Tokyo said.
Later, he was president of management and government employees, the Kremlin's web site (using Russian) said.
Since his appointment, he told Mr. Putin, said: "Thank you for your trust."
I think this government's most important task is to support the head of state in drafting legislation and control commands to implement.
Mr. Putin told Russian television on Friday, said Mr. Ivanov submitted his resignation and recommended Mr. WA Yinuo to take over as their own.
So smile convincing to you?
Moscow was puzzled by this move.
Sergei Ivanov, has long been one of Putin's closest aides, with Vladimir Putin, as well as in the Soviet Union had worked Security (KGB).
As the chief of staff, he was one of the country one of the most influential people.
State television broadcast in a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin will be on the surface, two people alleged to be the chief of staff to resign on his own request.
Although she was all smiles in front of the camera, but hardly convincing - - particularly in parliament before the election this time.
So, this is a lost cause in the fight for power, aren't they?
not yet known.
However, the official story - a presidential candidate once considered a candidate to choose Russia suddenly at the helm of environmental policy - attracted many doubts.
The Kremlin website quoted Mr. Ivanov dialogue with Mr. Putin, he said: "Yes, in early 2012, I worked in a conversation asking you to be this difficult position, and could even be said to be in trouble with the post, four years in office."
"As a result, I have served as the director General Of The Office Of four years eight months now."
Mr. Ivanov, to the post in December 2011.
Previously, he served as deputy prime minister and minister of defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council, also told Mr Putin, and is also a former member of the National Security Agency.
the late 1990s, when Mr. Putin as a Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly the National Security Agency), the secretary for Mr. Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
After Mr. Putin came to power, he appointed Mr. Ivanov is one of the five people he trusted most.
Outside once considered Mr. Ivanov, Mr. Putin could be in for a second term as president after the end of the third term, which is a violation of the constitution.
But the job ultimately belong to another close Putin aide Dmitry Medvedev (Dmitry Medvedev).
In three and a half years after the restart, before serving as president, Mr. Putin, the Russian prime minister.

Now leads unto kvinsferri Bridge in Fife
The £1,350,000,000 cost of the project is planned to be completed in May 2017
The engineers have already put kvinsferri (Queensferry Crossing) bridge in Northbridge in the face and viaducts that connect them together now leads unto Bridge to Fife.
It is located near the bridge around three a bridgehead "deck fan" closure is nearing completion of the project, which led to the closure of a bridge.
The bridge started in Fife 600 metres long, weigh 30,000 tonnes.
It employs 10,000 tonnes of steel, 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 Root of cable.
The £1,350,000,000 cost of the project is planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown (Keith Brown) visited the site today, becoming the first boarded one of the bridge.
He said: "This is kvinsferri in bridge construction in the course of a historic moment."
We have embarked on a project so ambitious in engineering work, the construction of the bridge, which was used for a period of more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel.
Despite the size and weight of the bridge, but were very huge viaduct and completion of the bridge closure between the delicate operation was required, need to be very precise assembly.
Overall, nearly 79 per cent of the total bridge has now been installed, the final paragraph of the bridge deck is pouring concrete in Rosyth today, which means that all the deck had been well located as it is ready.
In kvinsferri bridge construction company Project director Michael Martin said: "Whatever the bridge project, the first closure of a major milestone."
On this great project, this time showing the closure of civil engineering at the forefront of technology.
The last part of the way and will be connected to the expanded panel of Northbridge Fort - the road of the panel, then there needs to be done on land or close to the north side of the remaining gap closure.
To complete the task required the North approach viaduct south of 700 millimetres.
This is a massive job, at the same time, it's a very sophisticated operation.
said its magnitude was because viaduct 222 metres long and weighs about 6,000 tonnes, need to pull up a roughly 3 per cent gradient.
It is precisely because the team needs to ensure it's a very small deviations, each side has only a few millimetres.
It is comforting to know that everything went smoothly.
Simon Beiers jieter women's gymnastics all-around champion.
Forget pressure.
Forget about hype.
Simon Byers (Simone Biles) from all of this impact.
The vault is full of energy.
Luxury on the beam.
Stunning gymnastics freedom.
Overall performance was amazing.
Now, finally became an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnastics all-around champion picked up Thursday, fully in the Olympics, she was shown at the gymnastics world leader in talent.
In her overall score of 62.198 than silver medallists, "the group of five people" (Final Five) players Riceman (Aly Raisman) and bronze medalist Russia's Yelena Mustafa Vanna (Aliya Mustafina).

Byers to help the U. S. Olympic women's gymnastics individual all-around achieved four years on, she personally during the Olympics won a total of five medals, further proves she is the next generation, maybe ever, to the best of the gymnastics team.
When you see yourself in that moment, a total of Byers couldn't stop crying. She finally put an end to this long journey.
Byers was like Michael Phelps among (Michael Phelps) like "set off the worst year for athletes" ranks, they will each field sport to a new height:
Byers recently three years has dominated the competition, with a total of 15 medals won the World Championship medals, including 10 gold medals. She had aspirations to train hard every day to achieve greater accuracy. The 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton (Mary Lou Retton) said: "Byers is the best I've seen a gymnast."
In Brazil, there is also the last game, but the game is less about Byers and other gymnasts competition, as it is with huge expectations of her own race between pressure.
If Byers did not return to her gold medal with a Texas-based Spring's Jia, everyone will be very disappointed.
American Simon Byers (left) and Riceman hug each other, they're in August in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Thursday) The 2016 Summer Olympics Gymnastics Artistic Women's individual all-around final to win gold and silver respectively.
Beiers Yu Tuesday to win the first gold medal, the former national coach card Rowley (Martha Karoly Takai) a surprise offer to the party's largesse.
Although Byers maintained his world championship held in prolonged the process didn't have any plan for the future, but that's not really like that.
Byers free gymnastics of a paragraph - - including her trademark somersaults threaded a piece of that, with a Latin music, and the music is with her at the Rio Olympic Stadium only a house across the street to listen to.
It's no coincidence.
It was adopted in infancy, and grandparents in a stadium field trip when the coach Aimee Burman (Aimee Boorman) found the girl's mother has now grown into force.
Since the summer of 2013, not in the all-around competition Beierson miss, just want to win, she will win.

Waiting for the final score came out, gently Riceman hold up thanks to Sears. When Byers was informed of the results achieved his dream, after suddenly leaving in tears.
Riceman acted a little like the revenge four years ago, when she was tied for third, but lost the decider in Zita Fenner.
But this time, this was an American drama called "Grandma," said 22-year-old captain ahead of the curve.
She's free after blowing a kiss to the crowd of gymnastics, announcing the return of return, but before that, and sometimes it looks like there is some doubt about it.
Beiers-cai 19 years old. from earlier in the week, its message on Twitter to spread like a virus. It Bayerce, his life has been given a new meaning.
"Several times in the upper body" at the age of 6 in Philadelphia Mahaj Brown survived the shooting.

Investigators told CBS Philadelphia, looks like more gunmen exchanged fire.
A lot of offensive weapons found at the scene of the shell, we can assume that they are using different offensive weapons.
The judge, there is no doubt that this is a constant battle.
Two sides of the street there are shell casings on the sidewalk.
"So we can see that there are many militants in battle mode," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi said on television.
The region has a lot of houses and vehicles were damaged.
Sting operation, has not yet been implemented, it is said that the police look at CCTV footage.
On Tuesday, and a six year-old children (girls), based in the West Oak Lane neighborhood playing outside their home when they were shot in the arm by a stray bullet.
She is now recovering, and the police are still hunting the suspects.
Why do we need to have Simon, Gabriel and Laurie.
I just say this year's women's Olympic team, and more than one reason.
First of all, since 1984, I went to every summer Olympics, but the United States has held such dominance.
Secondly, a gymnastics team have three elite gymnasts - Simon Byers (Simone Biles), Gabriel Douglas (Gabby Douglas) and Laurie Hernandez (Lauren Laurie Hernandez), who has been an inspiration to many colored girl.
The composition of this contingent makes everyone feel proud, because it contains a Jewish Ali Riceman (Aly Raisman) and Catholic Madison Keshan (Madison Kocian).
The team finally looks like the American contingent.
It also cemented black and Hispanic women in the sport's top position.
Over the past four years, leading female gymnasts have been African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabriel breakdown first and second.
That's amazing.
The previous Olympic, Gabriel Douglas "surprising" to become Olympic champion, which was hailed by the United States.
Today, the whole world can witness three world champion Simon Byers, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez a wonderful performance. They get regular gymnastic skills played superbly.
On Thursday, Simon to help the US team at the Women's individual all-around project for four years.
Her teammate Ali Riceman won a silver medal.
We climbed to the top of the sport, but across America teaching gymnastics class does not.
Simon, Gabriel and Laurie entered the Olympic team with Ali and Madison avenues as well.
They are "the ultimate in five groups of people" (Final Five), because the next Olympic gymnastics team will consist of four members of the gymnasts is Marta Karoly Takai coached last year.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, gymnast mainly in private gymnastics club for their training, their parents need to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, games and hotel costs (including coaches and gymnasts and their associated costs), and the growing list of expenses.
Most of the gymnastics club is located in support for the industry's affluent suburbs.
All the gymnasts have completed training in these clubs, the gymnast households is a long-term high expenses.
Byers coach Aimee Burman (Aimee Boorman) and Hernandez's coach Maggie Haney, since the two gymnasts who switched to gymnastics, which has been coaching them.
We must be more affordable, more accessible gymnastics training brings countless plagued by Simon, Gabriel and Laurie effect on young girls.
Twenty years ago, I have set up their own gymnastics Foundation.
In my organization in Harlem, where we were more than 15,000 to urban youth (mostly black and Hispanic) to provide free, cheap gymnastics, and develop a national and world championships.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), to those who deserve the opportunity to learn from this and will be of great benefit to the Olympic movement of young people with high-quality gymnastics.
Exercise helps build physical strength, flexibility and coordination, and also help foster a spirit of hard work, self-discipline and commitment.
These can be a person's health, education and job benefits for lifelong success.
Inspired by this army contingent, tens of thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, it's really good.
Participation in sport is significant, particularly for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thanks to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabriellegyptian Madison won the Olympic gold medal in the course of the show a "girl power", and thanks to their inspired so many young girls from different backgrounds to open a healthy, strong, the path to success.
Jeremy Hunt rejected proposals, after junior doctors planned to launch further strikes
Ministers initially hoped that by accepting the British Medical Association (BMA) officials modified contract to bring an end to this dispute triggered by the change, but 37,000 junior doctors who participated in the vote, with 58 per cent oppose the contract.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to enforce contracts, he said the UK National Health Service (NHS) is currently in "no-man's land," a delay would damage the interests of staff and patients.
New contract for junior doctors first referred to modify all night and weekend work practices, in order to improve the care of normal working hours.
Last night, BMA junior doctor committee chair Ellen McCourt, PhD, said in a statement: "Junior doctors over proposed contracts still have serious concerns, particularly worried that it would exacerbate the current workforce crisis, and would not be fair to all of the doctors."
From the first doctor to sign a new contract with only eight weeks, we need to make progress, we don't have much time.
BMA to resolve disputes through negotiation, but we are not willing to engage in, and sometimes the government response in silence.
Nevertheless, just last month we have got Jeremy Hunt's commitment, he said that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt now need to take action to enforce the cancellation to address junior doctors" concerns.
If he doesn't do this, junior doctors made it clear that they are ready to take further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April, resulting in nearly 13,000 single conventional surgery and 100,000 cases of delayed appointments because nurses and consultants to cover doctors on picket lines.
Ministers initially hoped the BMA to accept a revised contract to bring an end to this dispute triggered by the change.
The BMA wants a contract to 54,000 junior doctors involved in the fight for better wages for the weekend.
NHS Employers chief executive Daniel Mortimer called on junior doctors don't staged any strikes again.
Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action had little effect, it's already paid full contingent and service pressures, resulting in patients, carers and their families worry, anxiety and confusion."
Over the past two months, we continue to negotiate with the junior doctors committee, and the Ministry of Health and other sectors to respond positively to their roles, and to report to the Guardian to expose fears.
Employers want to continue to actively explore other important topic - such as deployment, training, flexibility for those who break the careers of other people after repeated training, training costs, the common perception of the syllabus, study leave, and medical gender wage gap, these instructions, the employers' organisation Health Education England (Health Education England) and the Ministry of Health in November, February and May, with agreements reached at the BMA's attention.
£2 a day drug may reduce heart attack threat
Officials suggested that the £2 a day to promote the drug to more patients and to extend a medication time, after thousands of heart patients benefit from this drug.
anticoagulant drug for card Gray (ticagrelor) can reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence in patients with heart disease.
This drug has been taking following a heart attack in 12 months, a stroke or a heart, which can reduce the risk of another attack.
The British National Health Service (NHS) - affiliated national regulators Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends that patients taking the last four years, in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now, the NHS watchdog NICE recommended four years continued medication to patients, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, every year there are about 140,000 people suffering from heart disease, of which a quarter will continue to suffer a heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are fatty substances in the artery walls to form plaque deposition.
If plaque is broken, it can lead to blood clots, and it prevents the blood from flowing to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If a blood clot, it will move into the bloodstream, preventing blood flowing to the brain, causing a stroke.

Gray for cards by UK company AstraZeneca (AstraZeneca) manufacturing with Times Linda (Brilique) for making the sale, trade by reducing blood clot formation to reduce disease risk.
The NICE draft guidance published today suggested patients taking 90 mg for a Grey card 12 months time, after three years of daily use of 60 mg for card time Gray and two aspirin.
NICE health technology evaluation centre director, Professor Carole Longson said: "Although there are effectively two levels of preventive treatment, but there are more than 1/4 had a heart attack suffered patients will relapse or stroke, usually would have severe consequences."
The fear of recurrence would have on a person's quality of life had a significant negative impact.
evidence that Gray and aspirin together for card use can reduce those experienced a heart attack in patients with recurrence of heart attack and stroke risk.

China's Mars plan here.
China wants a Mars mission to achieve orbit and landing, the form, which has been in a foreign country.
Our goal is to launch exploration of Mars to step around, landing, visiting, this task has been particularly challenging.
Because Mars probe to 26 months in order to meet a time window, so experts are working closely to develop projects in 2020, the window for me to launch its first Mars probe.
According to Xu Dazhe said although the spacecraft has entered into deep space, but completed a Mars mission to Mars is indispensable, means China is truly entering the era of deep space exploration.
"Every two years or three years, just one time, Mars, Earth's most recent opportunities, at this point in time to launch Mars probe, the rocket is the most provincial energy."
"Taking into account the Mars probe's quality, it would be up to our long march five of rocket launches to complete."
China wants a Mars mission to achieve orbit, landed, visits abroad, a form that is never, ever, to have been abroad for a time around and landing, but landing failed.
Mars probe relates to so many of the technical areas, special branch also lies in the fact that while the rover is a space probe, but compared with the general space probes, it also has its own distinctive characteristics.
In other words, the Mars rover to identify a driving route, found dangerous obstacles to capacity.
China Aerospace Science and Technology Group Five, Pang Zhihao, a researcher at the Institute of human beings to Mars so fascinating, because Mars has important science, technology, and even more significance in relation to the future of humanity.
Today Mars has become a human research, other than on Earth, where the highest levels of the planets, and use of human space exploration of Mars probes of almost throughout human history is heading.
As a result, the humans to Mars in the hope of one day building residential base, ultimately to Mars immigrants, to turn it into people's second homes.
Plenty of evidence also suggests that Mars used to be possible with the current planet over billions of years, just like the evolution of the atmosphere, they become thinner, lower temperatures, water depletion might look like.
As a result, or manned Mars probe to conduct research into the earth, to prevent human to survive the two made plans for Mars.
As of June 2016, the Global Times carried out a total of 114, 43 times for lunar exploration exploration of Mars.
However, from the 1990s, has conducted a total of 18 times human exploration of Mars and the moon probe carried out only 14 times.
There are currently five Mars orbiters and two rovers on Mars are in work, but only one moon orbiter and a lander on the moon is at work.
Space World powers are prepared to Mars exploration program targeting system, suggesting that today's Mars probe is hotter than the moon.
5 November 2013, India launched its first Mars probe "Manchester Garrian" to become the first Asian country to Mars exploration success.
"Gary's Ann" are used to study Martian surface features, minerals, atmosphere and explore Mars for methane and signs of life.
The hardest part of this mission is to probe entered the Martian atmosphere and parachutes down aerodynamic shape after only get one chance.
According to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation five houses in general device chief designer of Sun Zezhou Mars probe, the Mars mission is facing a number of technical challenges.
Mars' atmospheric pressure on Earth's surface is very low, with only 1 per cent of the atmospheric pressure, which has a very high level of uncertainty.
It's about change and when factors such as storm characteristics, scientists haven't yet poorly understood.
In the summer, often forming planet similar to Earth of the dust storms, which could lead to a rover received a sharp decline in the sunlight, it is important for the rover is designed to "sleep" mode that lets its waited patiently for the storms of the past.
At the same time, the sun shone on the Martian atmosphere as well as reduce the role of energy supply for the Mars exploration brings challenges.
This will require a much larger solar covered detectors, and need constant adjustments to the direction of the sun.
The surface of Mars, and only 38% of earth's gravity, but better than most of the surface of the moon's gravity, so the probe needs more power.
"This Mars mission to the core, the hardest part is to probe entered the Martian atmosphere and aerodynamics and parachute to slow down the process, have only one chance to ensure success."
Sun Zezhou said, because of the distance between Earth and Mars, the whole process is not far from the surface real-time control, so they must rely on independent probe is completed.
In the absence of so many propellant to offset such high speeds, so Mars, slow down when you want to rely on the role of the Martian atmosphere, but if it is difficult to simulate the Martian atmosphere.
Pang Zhihao, overall, Mars probe to the moon with the way the way, is similar to "around, left, Rangers are back," and, ultimately, the goal of a manned mission to Mars.
Because of the distance from Earth to Mars to the Earth than the moon is much farther away, so Mars will need to conquer a more complicated set of technical difficulties.

He explained "form has fluctuated" refers to economic indicators of growth in July was indeed retreated.
In July, both at home and abroad because the economy is still in a deep adjustment, in complex and volatile international situation, the recovery of the world economy was less than expected, so export pressures or larger.
From a domestic point of the entire economy is at a crucial stage, adjusted for restructuring in the wake of the release, not the small economy is facing downward pressure, so there are some indicators some volatility.
For the transport of Sheng noted that, in July, there is also a special case, floods and droughts more severe weather, with some regions sweltering heat production and operation brought some impact.
According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, in the case of the recently released National 6,000 more than one million people were affected, with direct economic losses of more than 200,000,000,000 yuan.

According to the Bureau of Meteorology portal for the District of hot weather statistics, apart from the rest of the city, I must all be able to receive allowances to varying degrees of heat.
At present, the country has been at least 28 provinces allowance provides a clear standard, but the standard is not issued by the provinces and cities like Chongqing, which is a hot day in the form of subsidies for high temperature allowance.
35 ° C and above under the age of 37 ° C per person per day, according to no less than 10 billion standard issue; 37 ° C or more, according to no less than 15 yen per person per day for standard issue.
temperatures above 40 ° C Maximum Monthly staff are paid 20 yuan a day allowance (the worker has to enjoy high temperature operation of allowances excepted).
According to this standard, hot weather last month, the most days of the open state get 330 yuan, the least number of days chengkou is 80 yuan, and the Heat must for failing to meet high standards, high temperatures, so there are no benefits.
Many units used to cool drinks allowance to offset high temperatures, the municipal bureau of Work Safety said such acts inconsistent with the current approach.

At the same time because of the Heat allowance is part of wages, is not to be included in total wages, benefits, tax deductions.
High temperatures in the allowance is not within the scope of the minimum wage must be paid in cash, not in kind, such as drinks can be used instead.

Industry data shows that in 2015 its total coal production capacity close to 6,000,000,000 tons, national coal overcapacity 1,800,000,000 tons.
Nearly ten years, before and after the State Department has issued a total of five out of excess and outdated production capacity to inform.
While the fourth is not directed against the coal industry, but target industries a relationship directly with the coal industry.

In response, China (Hainan) Institute for Reform and Development director Kuang Xianming economy through the analysis and interpretation.
Kuang Xianming: to productivity has been a source of great concern to the coal sector, announced today the capacity of the transcript does make people feel more worried.
On the surface of one of the three factors still reflects a shift in the past, our growth has lagged behind the reason is that growth is led by the government so far, there has been no fundamental shift.
The second, which is also linked to the efforts of local government, is directly related to the production process, the funding and the appropriate measures are in place, in this view, differences in different parts of a lot.
Third, if the current progress, some provinces has been slower to catch up in the second half, they are likely to be exposed to greater risk.
In this case, relying on central prize money to push into the production process might have a negative impact.
First of all, to productivity is not simple for total control.
Our aim is to eliminate outdated capacity, promote structural optimization, reconstruction of the coal industry as a whole new industry.
In the process of deploying to capacity, local government must be put to more productive and the coal industry's transformation and upgrading, combining a strong development of related services.
Second, if you want to in the course of this year to productivity tasks to complete this year, we still have to play a full administrative supervision and administrative surveillance powers.
Finally, we need to strengthen Social Security's fallback role.

Ning Zetao the 100 metres freestyle semi-final performance, has made a lot of Chinese audiences speechless.
And yet, in the 50m freestyle heats, Ning Zetao once again to refresh people's "bottom line".
It is not the 50 meters freestyle Ning Zetao, his world championships in Kazan and the performance of the best achievements, as well as his decision on the project is not likely to make a breakthrough.
Sure enough, Hong Kong media authority Ta Kung Pao said Ning Zetao defeat, the biggest reason is simply that he has lost interest in the swim.
Many outside factors that may affect his ideas for the future, he has had a significant impact on the entertainment industry are now more likely to be interested.
The Kazan World Championships, Ning Zetao, with its high value Yang and good grades, and instantly become a network of red.
As a result, "the husband" or "little fresh meat," "flower boy" also continue to be addressed, such as on his label.
Looking for a variety of commercial activities, the better the money started to become a gold, shimmering Avenue.
In this case, Ning Zetao even choose to retire in the entertainment industry, it is not just his freedom, is also a plausible path.
After all, he's only 23 years of age, a certain amount of learning, it can be in popularity, with its 12 drama.
Ning Zetao, however, need to look at ourselves and compared these predecessors, Aren't enough qualified?
The 2000 Sydney Olympics, it has been 21 years, Liu Xuan of athletes have come to the end of his career.
Liu Xuan appearance makes her pretty quickly, be remembered for her next foray into the Entertainment Industry Foundation.
After retiring, Liu Xuan appeared in many TV series in 2013, and set up his own studio.
Tian participated in the two games were a pair of ten metres a game, and earned two gold, two silver.
But at the 2004 Games single ten metres a game after losing to teammate Hu Jia Tian, a dip in form, and was expelled by the diving team.
But he and his daughter attend the "where's Dad" variety show, such as more is to get him to the pockets of the eyeball.
Former gymnastics gold generation, Li Wei and Chen Yibing are high-profile participated in a variety of arts programs.
It's worth noting at the time, Li Wei, China's leading champion men's team for the 2008 Games is two times more Wei, the individual all-around gold medal, known as all-powerful king.
But Chen Yibing, led by the Chinese to get the 2012 Olympic team title at the same time, it also became the king's rings.
At the London Olympics but suffered a miscarriage and lost the gold medal later, Chen Yibing magnanimous gesture also lets him countless Li Fen.
But the main focus of the current players still out on the field, for a variety show is just a touch - - - - - - - - - - - - - - such as make it go away.
But either retired or active athletes, will be favored in the entertainment industry needs to be done to safeguard presentable results.
After all, athletes to move into a new realm, whether capacity or relationships, is a blank.
Even Tian, Liu Xuan Entertainment spent so many years of "The old man," a general audience, the more they thought of their performance at the Olympics.
Wei, Li Xiaopeng and newcomer, such as the introduction of the variety show appearances, no exceptions are "Olympic champion".
Compared to the previous one, Ning Zetao a swimming world champion's reputation is still thin.
What's more, compared to Tian, Liu Xuan Wei, et al., Ning Zetao who retired at the age of 23, in a career setback would retire, the negative impact of the image may be immeasurable.
After all, about athletes, people's claims are "Don't ask victorious, but please, not afraid of hard," Ning Zetao distance it was missed by a lot.
At the very least, Ning Zetao handsome, can completely rely on face value if it received the support of the cerebral residual powder.
no little skill on appearances, only to succeed in the entertainment industry, it is good to mix this difficulty is not due back to training so hard, was it a state.
Life is all a matter of personal choice, but how to choose, Ning Zetao know it.

Any mistake will now be the public attention.

Thus, when the application for some users this week provides a can create strabismus, blame the tooth and powder filter effects, some critics have dubbed it the Asian "yellow" racial satire.
they even think of these recurring question of whether that means the company's diversity is a big problem.
In the Snapchat said its removal of the feature on Wednesday after The Verge and Motherboard reports have sparked outrage.
The company's explanation is: The filter to pay tribute to the comic roles, rather than satirical Asians.
But for the experienced racism in the Observer, which reminded them of the filter with the reality of the harmful stereotypes.
Others have strongly objected to the cartoon character.
One of these photographs published on Twitter and has been widely shared in a Korean American art said in an email that these filters "at least was a source of pain and discomfort."
She also said: "It's hard to distinguish between extreme nausea Asian satirical image and filter results."
It's not just the mirror Though ay yellow, but yellow is extremely underrated.
Snapchat isn't the only one to reach the finish line of the Culture Company.
The company's board of directors from Hollywood and the devices we carry, appears to have been in American culture to promote diversity and inclusion.
A large group of young because Snapchat than the older generation is more focused on racial diversity and, therefore, may be very sensitive.
When a Snapchat filter produced an insult to the user's image, the 25-year-old Zhu Kaidi (UNC) in Thursday's interview, said: "Compared to the previous, such things harder to escape attention."
On Thursday, in the Medium as a product manager and engineer Zhu had decided to remove her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.

Congressional panel that military officials have skewed intelligence on ISIS
A congressional panel on Thursday, according to the report, released by the U. S. Central Command officials changed the intelligence reports, the fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, describing the war situation than they actually are more optimistic.
This interim report from a military commission, by the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee and the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee's Defense Subcommittee Chairman of the Republican Party to form a special working group. Reports that CENTCOM intelligence analysts there exists "a wide range of grievances," the analysts said they were at a higher level of tampering with the United States and the Islamic State's assessment of the battle.
Located in Tampa, Florida's Central Command (Centcom) is responsible for the supervision of the United States is in the Middle East and central parts of the military headquarters of military operations.
According to a report on news of the report, "the Central Command senior leaders to review intelligence for the U. S. counter-terrorism operations description than it really is more optimistic, and has been compared to other intelligence agency's analysis is more optimistic."
California Republican representative said: "The Central Command's behaviour is unacceptable. Our fighters on one side is war-weary, on the other side were the top policy makers received the wrong analysis. "
The leadership of the Central Command issues have been extended to the bodies at the highest level.
The report details a 2014-2015 description and analysis of the central command in the United States training the Iraqi army has long-standing problems.
Although there was no definitive evidence that The Obama administration's top officials ordered changes to those reports, but according to a description of the report, these analysts feel under pressure from Central Command leader, forcing them to pressure the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL) threat issued a more optimistic view.
The report said that "in the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command's press release, statements and testimony to Congress than it actually was much too optimistic."
For example, a Central Command officials say it could open as early as April or May 2015, a large-scale military operation to retake Mosul.
Iraq's second largest city of Mosul remains under the control of the Islamic State.
Kansas Republican Rep. Mike Pompo said in a statement. "After months of investigation, the results have been very clear."
Since mid- 2015 to mid- 2014, the U. S. Central Command's most senior intelligence officials to manipulate the headquarters of the intelligence product, concealing the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq.
Republicans had learned from the analyst on intelligence on the Islamic State are being manipulated, and set up a special working group.
As the investigation continues, after this Thursday's release of the report found that there will be many more.
The Ministry of Defence and the attorney general's office for the Central Command investigation for a long time.
Members of the House intelligence committee Democrats announced on Thursday the results of its investigation, and the Republican party dedicated to some of the conclusions of the working group to be consistent.
The committee Democrat Xie Anda representative said in a statement. During 2014-2015, the central command for the Islamic State and Iraqi security forces intelligence assessment has developed a process that is too narrow. "
Mr. Xie Anda said the process "inhibits the release of information," reducing the analyst's morale and "unable to accept different points of view."
But Mr. Xie Anda and Democrats have also said they found no evidence to prove that the White House of trying to pressure of CENTCOM analysts, thus, their conclusion is consistent with "the default or political narrative."
'The Beast daily reports to Congress on Tuesday, the preliminary results of the survey.
Eight months of last year, the New York Times reports the CENTCOM analysts after receiving complaints from the Pentagon after the attorney general's office began an investigation.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said in a statement that the attorney general's investigation is not completed before the end of this parliament to the Ministry of Defence does not comment on that report.
But he said: "experts had sometimes complex data interpretation, divisive, and intelligence agencies, and the Ministry of Defence had encouraged these important national security topics for a healthy dialogue."
This survey is greater than the impact of U. S. leadership in Iraq and Syria if the bombing campaign make (more defense officials alleged) success of this problem.
But last year, these advocates questioned whether President Obama could make public the extent of the central command trust, issued by Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas to assess the military action.
The criticism of the Islamic conditions reminiscent of out ten years ago, when the controversy over CENTCOM intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper, the paper pointed out that George W. Bush, despite the opposition of many analysts, insist on sending troops to Iraq on a small scale and almost did not take into account the situation after the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hook on Islam in the country in opposition activity played a key role in.
Last year, officials have said that Mr. Hook's team are the conclusions of the air strikes against Islamic State refineries have not significantly reduced income for terrorist organizations, as the terrorist organization built makeshift refineries continue to sell oil on the black market, and that the statement released Sunday.
According to The Times reported in September, the Central Command did not announce the discovery.
When more lawyers to review the war on an overly optimistic assessment in testimony to the Senate, the CENTCOM commander Lloyd Austin criticised last year.
General Austin, now retired in April, by Joseph Walters took his place in the central command post.

As a result of steel enterprises to large scale, covering a wide range of assets, some of the debts of the business relationship is complex, if mishandled, potentially triggering a regional risks.
According to the official introduction, in recent years, with economic downward pressure, community gradually weakened aggregate demand, industry capacity utilization of production decline in operating difficulties intensified.
Some firms are adapting to changing market conditions, production and business untenable, and even on the verge of collapse, but was subject to a number of institutional factors, the obstacles to market means more, become a "zombie enterprises".
The existence of such enterprises, have distorted the market signals elements, reduces the efficiency of resource use, increased social management costs and hamper the creation of a market environment of fair competition.
The main reason for the losses in the global steel industry is facing a dilemma - as weak market demand, capacity utilisation is low.
My main take market mechanisms, financial means and the rule of law for government employees, mostly good fallback and social stability, to ensure that fair and orderly markets.
The official stressed that the next step, are determined to continue to work to ensure a capacity to do a good job to finish five years to defuse crude steel capacity 100,000,000 ~ 150,000,000 tons of goals.

Portland Aluminum Company of America 2000 factory workers may face a job loss.
Once the factory was closed, there may be as many as 2000 people directly or indirectly unemployment.
The factory and as a result of all of Victoria's energy consumption accounts for about 10 per cent of the electricity output and, therefore, may also have a ripple effect.
In 2014, Alcoa smelter closure of the Cape Ray is, this has led to the closure of the coal-fired power plants last year island Sharron Angle.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is currently loss-making and face off risk.
This is the future of the plant after a few years to make predictions, initially because of the stronger Australian dollar and, more recently, to the factory because the price of the product.
La Trobe Valley AGL through old Eric yangfa power plants for the large aluminium smelter with electricity. The company is forecasting a further three factory owners will also terminate its agreement.
Factory is the largest shareholder of a company and a alkoa alumina company's joint venture, while China's CITIC Group and Japan's Marubeni Corporation also holds a small stake.
The joint venture, said: "AGL expects Portland plant will continue to operate, which means that this operation will continue to produce electricity needs."
AGL said the contract is what should have been in effect since November 2016, "hedging contracts."
termination of the contract for 12 months, so they will expire in 2017.
The power company said: "As a result, AGL still forecast these contracts will be in the 2017 fiscal year to continue to generate revenue."

The UK must now pass the Olympic spirit and the expansion of Heathrow Airport
Heathrow will also contribute to our communities and across the country, London's dynamism and prosperity.
For me, this is Heathrow's charm, as in the 2012 London Games, when we do our utmost to ensure our country or region can benefit from these events.
The Stratford and east would benefit from the Games.
And we will be in the vicinity of Heathrow through the local people and businesses to create opportunities for the benefit of the region.
only with respect to our local communities are concerned, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeship positions, 40,000 new jobs and enable the airport around young people out of unemployment woes.
As the London 2012 Olympic Games, with some arguing that Heathrow expansion project is too big.
I was told that the UK will not be able to prepare for the games, and we would lose face in the world.
For the 2012 Olympics sceptic doubt is wrong, and they are also suspected of Heathrow projects will be proved wrong.
While there will always be obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow is to solve every problem facing.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is for most people, rather than by a few people to carry out infrastructure projects.
expansion project will create up to 180,000 new jobs, with £211,000,000,000 of economic growth, the UK and around the airport to leave a big technology and employment, wealth.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team. The team was on time and within budget completed a £11,000,000,000 investment in infrastructure projects, including five consecutive year elected the world's best airport terminal and at Terminal 5 in the world's busiest runways between two of the T2 terminal.
Now, they are prepared to £16,000,000,000 of private investment to build a third runway.
The UK successfully hosted the 2012 London Olympics, and I am confident that Heathrow Airport expansion project will also be a great success.
Now it is we're passing the Olympic spirit and expansion of Heathrow Airport in good time, so that we can for our future escort and create a lot of money to make the UK proud technology and employment, wealth.

NASA climate models: Venus was fit for human habitation
According to NASA's new climate model projections, Venus was unfit for human habitation.
NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies scientist has developed a could explore Venus, the last of the models, which use tools and algorithms and climate scientists are using very similar.
The model used to determine the surface water temperature, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of Venus, and whether there were similar to Earth's environment.
Previously, scientists believed that Venus spins slower because of its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation shows that Venus may have been a relatively thin, similar to the Earth's atmosphere and then spin similarly slow.
The model also shows early Venus terrain.
Venus in the dry area might have more than the Earth, but it has enough water to breed and geographical changes lives and prevent rapid evaporation.
On Venus, early exposure to the sun than the Earth's surface brightness of 30 per cent.
Goddard Institute for Space Studies scientist Anthony Del Zhioo explained in a press release: "The Goddard Institute for Space Studies model simulations, the Venus slow rotation to make their side of the daytime hours for nearly two months."
This causes the surface warming and had to be able to form a thick cloud of rain and thick clouds like an umbrella to block on the ground, as most of the heat from the sun.
The results of the simulation is an average temperature of the planet's climate is actually worse than a few degrees off the earth right now.
The model to simulate the evolution of Venus, the planets before the scientists speculate that similar.
Although life may have existed on Mars, but in the course of a few billion years, Venus is exposed to high levels of ultraviolet light and temperature.
The planet's oceans evaporate, water vapor also consumed by UV radiation.
With the escape of hydrogen, left the only thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and deadly greenhouse gas effect, thus forming the planet as we know it today.
Researchers in the Geophysical Research Letters journal, published in the new Venus climate model simulations.
Patrick Roy, resigned from the post of coach avalanche
Patrick swarm in the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday as ice hockey team coach and vice president, said he had no say in the decision-making level.
Colorado's Executive Vice President Joe Saatchis general manager confirmed the news and says the club will immediately begin looking for a new head coach.

The union said its recent action is in protest at the highest possible pay cuts of 30 per cent, and this is the first time in 25 years to take this action.
Wood Group this year because of market pressures and the North Sea contractors pay reduced by approximately 9 per cent.
The pay cuts, the company in 2014 before the Sea contractors pay has fallen by 10 per cent.
Company says it will cut again to help companies survive through the market downturn.
Shell has been reduced by thousands employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries, this is because the company British Gas and British energy company merged group to streamline its business.
Energy companies are facing a decline in crude oil prices from June, and the UK's Brexit decision under pressure.
Dave Anderson, a member of the Scottish Parliament earlier in the week to meet with union leaders to discuss this generation in the North Sea's biggest labour disputes.
He said the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
Dave said in a statement: "In the North Sea and the country as a whole, we need a service in the majority, not minority economy."
In 2016, the North Sea spending on new projects not expected to exceed $1,400,000,000, compared to an average of the past five years spending on projects to about $7,000,000,000.
The Kepler mission spin speed of stars.
The Kepler space telescope's latest mission to help astronomers the most complete collection of the star's rotation speed.
New data is helping astronomers understand why the cluster of stars with different spin and spin cycle associated with the composition of the planet.
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena Infrared Processing and Analysis Center, a research scientist at Rebel Lusatia, said at a news conference: "We hope that by comparing our results and other clusters further understanding of stellar mass, age, and even its solar historical relationship."
The Pleiades Mission, 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many of the cluster stars are born in about 125,000,000 years ago, is still just reaching adulthood.
They reached a life in the most high rotation speed.
When the rotation rate of the highest, these mature stars shoot lots of stellar wind.
When these stellar wind through the star's magnetic field, they will be able to produce stars braking.
As stars age, their rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler by tracking sunspots recognizable stars (like sunspots) the time to measure the spin speed of stars.
The latest rotation speed data sets show that high mass stars spin slower than the quality of the smaller star.
Ray Bull will star as a dancer, the bigger the dancer rotates slower than the smaller dancer.
Ray Bull said: "The mission of the" Ballet performing "We find that spin slower stars tend to high mass, and rotating the fastest stars tend to be the lightest stars."
Due to the close proximity of the Pleiades mission, so you can compare quality and stars as the ideal lab rotation rate of the universe.
Ray Bull said: "The Pleiades mission for young and old stars two-way rotation theoretical models for the future."
Stars on how, when and why the slow rotation speed and "put your shoes", we still have a lot of knowledge.
Ray Bull and her colleagues at three of the papers detailed their rotation speed for The Pleiades in the latest analysis. Soon the three papers will be published in The Astronomical Journal.
