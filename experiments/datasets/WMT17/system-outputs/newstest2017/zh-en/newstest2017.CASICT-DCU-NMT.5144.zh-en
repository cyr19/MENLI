The 28 cook was found dead in a San Francisco mall
A 28 chef, who has just moved to San Francisco, was found dead on the stairs of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother said he could not think of anyone who would want to harm him, and said, "Everything is finally good."
The San Francisco test said the body found on Wednesday morning at the Nishida shopping centre was confirmed as the 28 year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco police station said the death was found to have killed him and is under investigation.
Victims brother, the victim's brother, said Frank KGO, the former line chef in Boston, found an ideal job for a line chef in San Francisco, San Francisco, six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said they were "very shocked" about Frank's death.
"we are a small team with a close family, and we will miss him deeply," the spokesman said.
At this sad moment, we express our deep sympathy and condolences to Frank's family and friends.
Louis said Frank initially lived in a guest house, but recently "everything was finally good."
Louis told KGO: "Frank finds an apartment and is in contact with a girl."
Louis said he could not think of anyone who would want to harm his brother.
Frank has a good heart and a broad mind.
"Frank often cooks dinner for his family," Louis said.
He was never willing to quarrel with his family.
He was a man who followed the opinions of everyone.
"all things in the world are likely to go wrong, but Frank is a diamond man who shines every day," Louis said.
For a clue, please call the San Francisco Police Station to report telephone.
Primary doctor's strike: calls for new labour action
The representative of the primary doctor called on the Alliance to approve new labour actions against new contract disputes.
The British Medical Association primary Committee will require all its members to support more labour operations since early September.
The primary said the ministers did not resolve their concerns about the contract.
The primary doctor and medical students voted in July to boycott contract transactions with the British Medical Association.
Of the members participating in the voting, 58% were opposed to the contract.
Primary President, chairman of the primary Committee, said in a letter from a letters member on Twitter Thursday that the government "has always been silent" on the issue of the resistance to the contract.
"light, the Executive Committee of the primary Committee, has voted to reject the proposed new contract and calls for a resumption of formal consultations on all concerns," she said.
In response to the silence of the Government, the Executive Committee of the primary Committee officially requested the Council of the British Medical Association to convene a special session to approve a long-term plan aimed at upgrading labour operations from the beginning of September.
The dispute has led primary doctors to participate in six strikes this year, including the first comprehensive strike in the history of the British National Medical Service.
Dr. Johann Malawana, a junior doctor leader of the British Medical Association, resigned after a boycott of the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the British Medical Association.
In a meeting before the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students, he had said to the British Medical Association members that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Hunt Hunt, said the contract would be enforced in England's medical staff.
Russia and Turkey: "incompatible Union"?
A gesture ended a crisis.
Russia and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday, shaking hands and announcing a formal end to eight months of rhetoric and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin met the President of Turkey in the magnificent halls of a Petersburg palace, I had a strong feeling that the settlement was the most promising thing in Ankara.
Yes, the two sides did shake hands.
However, even in the light of Mr. Putin's usual standards of convergence, Putin is only 浅浅微笑, with little enthusiasm.
The Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was reported to have referred five times to "good friend" Putin.
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia would return to the pre-crisis level, even at a higher level.
The next day, a newspaper wrote that Mr. Erdogan did not seem to have done anything.
But I think his enthusiasm suggests something to the contrary.
However, Mr. Putin's continued indifference suggests that he has not forgotten anything.
Indeed, the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was very intense.
Mr. Putin was violent against the incident, accusing Ankara of plotting against Moscow.
Attacks from so-called friends are more difficult to accept.
It is difficult, or even impossible, to re-establish real trust.
Since November, Russian public opinion has been reversed.
Over the months, the Government media carried out a shocking and shocking attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
Among them, the most serious is the criticism from senior officials: Mr. Erdogan's family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in the so-called State Syrian area.
He has categorically denied that claim.
However, the news from Petersburg showed that it was time to look forward.
After all, the meeting was premised on Mr. Putin's apology from the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the truce are obvious.
First, Erdoğan narrowly escaped from power after the defeat of the coup last month, so he needs the support of all his friends.
The ongoing terrorist attacks have apparently been a great blow to him.
There are also economic motivations.
Russian sanctions have been hit by Turkey, in particular the ban on air charter services that can deliver millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The figure has fallen by nearly 90%.
With the return of the flight, Russia's travel agency and charter company will be relieved.
They will usher in the end of the end of the Mediterranean Sea.
National television even predicted this week that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall once the import of Turkish agricultural products is 重新.
"the tourists went, and the tomato came back," a report from the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti.
For Moscow, the visit also has additional political value.
Ankara is outraged by the weak response of the Western world to the intention to take over.
Moreover, Ankara has long been dissatisfied with the slow pace of accession to EU negotiations and Putin's intervention, and Putin is keen to use political chill and weaken Turkey's relations with the West.
As a result of the defeat of the elected authorities after the coup failed, Russia's leaders will be given the points of Ankara.
Note that this is a gift for Moscow, which has been deeply rooted in fear of regime change.
As a result, the meeting in this magnificent seaside palace led to two Russian and Turkish allies who had been rejected and abused by the Western world, and an analyst described it as a "incompatible alliance."
However, despite public reconciliation, there are still significant differences between the two sides.
Syria is one of the key factors. Moscow has recently played a role in Syria, while Russia and Turkey have supported the opposite factions.
Predictably, after nearly three hours of preliminary conversation, the two presidents said at the conference that they had not yet talked about the topic.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the question of the differences between the two sides, while Putin emphasized.
There is no clear consensus between the two sides on how to find common ground on the Syrian issue.
The resumption of dialogue between the leaders of the two countries is certainly a good thing when the two leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Turkey, have brought down the months of public hostility and a major disaster.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland
Banks will be simplified as a logistics sector, according to the Chief Executive Officer of the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwen told the BBC Scotland that the Royal Bank of Scotland had been committed to its global ambitions.
But eight years ago, he was on the verge of bankruptcy and had to accept relief from that time to give up the pursuit.
At that time, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer financial brands.
The group has spent millions of pounds to sponsor the international sporting events, such as Andy Murray, the champion of the Rugby six and Wimbledon Tennis Championships.
But now, the right thing is to make more national brands figure.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not return to it.
In England and Wales, all references to headquarters and stock exchanges will be changed to the National Westminster Bank.
The brand has been used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Autonomous Region.
There are other more prominent private banking brands, such as bank Bank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's.
Mr. McEwen was interviewed in the visit of the customers and employees in Inverness County.
"the Royal Bank of Scotland will eventually become our investor brand and one of its employees, because we have become a bank with a large number of brands," he told BBC Scotland.
As the bank itself becomes an international brand, RBS has become a global brand.
At the moment, I would like to say that we no longer focus on the world, and we have turned our eyes to the country.
Each brand represents the differences in their respective industries, and our employees serve customers through different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has shown that it will not continue to sponsor the six tournament; at the same time, efforts have been made to raise the image of different brands in sports events.
"now it is time to become a more bank, because in private we have been exploring how to become a better service to customers."
If we aspire to become a big bank with many brands three years ago, it will be much.
Now we focus on customer needs, and I believe you have noticed these changes.
I think we can restart these brands, and the time is right now.
Dettori made 3,000
Two made 3,000
On Friday, the jockey, Dettori, won his 3,000 victory in Newmarket.
He policy the horse's hand in the hands of the practice Gosden, who had won two victories on the night, and was able to achieve a career of 3,000.
The 45 Italian is the sixth vocational jockey in the field of ground.
The first five were: Sir Gordon Richards (Gordon Richards), Doug Smith (Smith), Piggott (Lester), Wei Eddery and Carson (Willie).
"this is very special," said Dettori, the three champion jockey Dettori win, who was the winner of Ghayyar.
I'm very excited because my family is on the spot
I was pleased with my achievements in Newmarket, because I started here 30 years ago.
This is not a large Jockey Club or the Royal Jockey Club (Ascot), a common Friday night with a 20,000 audience.
I am very happy and humble.
Dettori took the Predilection after the victory, causing the whole crowd to be cheered
In the area of obstacles, two jockeys have achieved this achievement, namely, champion jockey Richard Johnson (Richard Johnson) and Sir McCoy, who is now retired, who won more than 4,300 victories in his record career.
Piggott is, a nine champion, won a total of 4,493 victories in his career
Dettori is one of the best jockeys in the day, so it is not surprising that he has achieved this landmark achievement, and there are few people who have made this achievement before.
He is fashionable and strong, but it is his tactical reason for him to stand out in the weighing room.
He was a great equestrian ambassador who, for many years, attracted a lot of fans to the campaign.
A few weeks ago, I told Dettori that if he was not just a weekend and a jockey, he should have got 6,000 wins!
It is important to say that Dettori is the best Equestrian winner in the UK in 30 years.
His character is good for the British horse, but in addition, he is an incredible jockey.
Dettori celebrated the milestone with its iconic jump dismount
From jumping to jump dismount, Dettori has been a typical representative of the British field in the past two decades.
His career is like a roller coaster.
He won a series of championships, including the famous "seven victory" of the British Royal Jockey Club in 1996, but he had also suffered from a crash and a ban on drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned to the stadium after six months of fixed, he had shown an amazing personality advantage, and finally returned to the top and gave a blow to those who were skeptical.
He may not have been able to do it for a long time - he said before he had said he wanted to compete at least by the age of 50.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's post of Chief of Staff, Sergei Ivanov
Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, unexpectedly lifted the office of the President of the President of Sergei Ivanov.
For many years, Mr. Ivanov has been a member of the core group that Mr. Putin has trusted.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
A statement by the Kremlin says Mr. Putin has "announced the post of Director of the Russian President's office," but no reason is given.
Anton Vaino, who began in 2012 as his deputy, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr. Vaino, aged 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, he graduated from the famous Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he managed the president's draft and government employees, the Kremlin website (in Russian).
After his appointment, he said to Mr. Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of this Government is to support the Head of State in the drafting of laws and control directives.
Mr. Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself had asked to resign and recommended Mr. Vaino to take over himself.
Is this smile convincing?
Moscow is puzzled about the move.
For a long time, Sergei Ivanov has been one of Putin's closest aides, like Putin, in the Soviet Security Agency (KGB).
As Chef de Cabinet, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on national television, both said that the Chief of Staff had asked to resign himself.
Although there was a smile on the front of the camera, almost no one was convinced - especially at this time before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this the result of a loss of power?
It is not yet known.
But the official argument that a candidate who had been seen as a presidential candidate suddenly chose to take charge of Russia's environmental policy - attracted a lot of doubts.
The Kremlin website quoted Mr. Ivanov's dialogue with Mr. Putin, who said: "Yes, at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to give me this difficult position, or even a troubled position, a four-year term."
"as a result, I have been the President of the Office of the President for four years and eight months."
Mr. Ivanov held the position in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Mr. Putin, is a former member of the National Security Agency.
In the late 1990s, Mr. Ivanov was appointed as his deputy when Mr. Putin served as the Director of the Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly the National Security Agency).
After Mr. Putin came to power, he had designated Mr. Ivanov as one of his five most trusted.
It was once considered that Mr. Ivanov might be a Russian president after Mr. Putin's second term of office, since the third term was unconstitutional.
But the position was ultimately attributed to Putin's other close aide, Dmitry Medvedev.
Until three and a half years later, Mr. Putin served as Prime Minister of Russia.
Mysterious fish
A resident of Banff found fish in his garden and then sent for help.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish may be 沙鳗 by a tornado by sea.
Mr. Bain, who lived about 500 metres from the sea, released a video of this strange scene on the Periscope, hoping that someone could explain why these two inches of fish would appear.
The Bridge has now reached Fife
The project of 13.5 billion is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the Bridge to the viaduct and the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now coming to Fife.
The closure closure, located near the three bridgehead of each bridge, is now nearing completion, and the project is the first Crossing bridge.
The bridge, which started in Fife, is 600 meters long, weighing 30,000 metric tons.
It uses 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 cables.
The project of 13.5 billion is planned to be completed in May 2017.
The Minister of Economy, Keith Brown, visited the scene today as one of the first people to climb the bridge.
"this is a historic moment in the construction of the Bridge."
We all witnessed the engineering work on such an ambitious project, with more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel.
Although the size and weight of the bridge are enormous, the completion of the bridge between the viaduct and the deck requires fine work, requiring very precise assembly.
In general, nearly 79% of the total deck is now installed, and the concrete deck of the last deck is pouring in Rosyth, which means that all the decks are ready.
"no matter which bridge project, the first closure is a major milestone," said Martin Martin, a project director of the Bridge Construction Company.
In the case of the great project, the closure shows the advanced civil engineering technology.
After installing the last road panel and connecting it to the expanded panel, it will be necessary to complete the remaining gap in the north or near the land side.
The completion of the operation would require the transfer of 700 mm south of the northern elevated.
This is a huge operation, and is also a very sophisticated operation.
It says it is large, because the viaduct is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 metric tons, and it needs to pull a gradient of about 3%.
It is accurate because the engineering team needs to ensure that the deviation is very small, with only a few millimetres on each side.
It is gratifying that everything is going well.
Simone off champion
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the hype.
Simon Biles is not affected by all this.
The vault was full of vitality.
The upper beam of the balance beam.
The movement of free gymnastics is amazing.
The overall performance is very good.
Now, finally, it became the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast picked up the Almighty champion and showed her talent for a leading world in gymnastics at the Olympic Games.
Her total score was far more than a silver medal winner, "Raisman (Aly Raisman), Raisman, and the bronze medal winner, Russian Mustafina, the Russian players.
Simon Biles, from the United States, carried out a balance beam on Thursday in the art women Final of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles helped the American team to achieve four titles on the Games of the Olympic women's gymnastics. She had won five medals at the Olympic Games, further confirming that she was a generation, and perhaps the best gymnast ever.
When she saw her score, Biles couldn't help shed tears. She finally finished the long journey.
As a result, Biles is among the same "decades athletes" like Michael Phelps, who upgrading the sports projects in their respective fields to a new height:
"Biles is the best gymnast I've ever seen," said Mary ·, the 1984 Olympic champion, Mary ·, "said Mary ·, the 1984 Olympic champion.
There is still a last game in Brazil, but the game is not so much the competition between Biles and other gymnastics, rather than a contest between herself and great expectations.
If Biles did not have a full gold medal back to her home in Spring, Texas, everyone would be very disappointed.
Simon Biles (left) and Raisman from, from the United States, embraced each other in August (Thursday) for the women of the 2016 Summer Olympics, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday, giving a surprise gift to the outgoing national coach, Karolyi Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted that he did not plan the future in the course of the year, it was not exactly the case.
A section of freedom's free gymnastics, including her landmark 翻腾, was accompanied by Latin music, which was often heard in her home with the Rio Olympics.
That is no coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by a grandparent during the baby, and was found by the mother of the coach, Amy Boorman, in a field visit to the stadium.
Since the summer of 2013, Biles has failed in the Almighty game, and she will win as long as she wants to win.
It is just an illusion that the Mustafina is a little ahead of the rotation.
The balance beam and the free gymnastics two projects of the defending world champion Biles 埋伏以待.
Her balance beam scored 15.433, and the free gymnastics score was 15.933.
When he was waiting for the final score, Raisman gave a gentle hug. When Biles learned that he had achieved the desired results, he left tears.
Raisman's performance was a bit like revenge for four years ago, when she was third, but lost to Mustafina in the final.
But this time, the 22-year-old leader of the American play, known as "Grandma," was far ahead.
She blew kisses to the crowd after the free gymnastics, declaring a return, but such a return sometimes seemed to be in doubt.
Biles was 19 years old. From earlier this week, the news was spread on Twitter, and his life had been given a new meaning.
Brown Brown, 6 years old, was spared from the shooting in Philadelphia
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, a second shot in the city's second shot in the city.
The child's grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the children who were shot were Brown Brown.
They say Brown's groin, legs, arms, and abdomen have a number of gunshot wounds, but the child is awake on the way to hospital.
"he was guilty of a lot of guilt, and the little body was hit by bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the TV station.
I can't believe it.
The boy was in a critical condition in the hospital and had undergone a number of surgeries.
His family told the television station that the child was expected to recover.
He would have begun to read the first grade in a local primary school.
Brown is one of the four men who were shot in the Germantown area.
Of the three others who had been shot, two were 29 years old and one was 32 years old.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the victims of the age of 29 is critical; the other two victims are stable.
According to the television station, the child was found in the front seat of the car with the 29 victim.
Two other victims were not in the vehicle, and the police were investigating whether there were gunmen in the injured.
The investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like a number of gunmen exchanged fire.
Many offensive weapons were found in the scene, which could be inferred that they were using different offensive weapons.
As a result, this is no doubt a 持续战.
There are shells on the sidewalk on both sides of the street.
"so, there were many armed men in the scene at the time," said the police director of Philadelphia, Anthony Ginaldi, to the television station.
Many houses and vehicles have been damaged in the region.
Arrests have not yet been carried out, and the police are said to be monitoring video footage in 调看.
On Tuesday, a six-year-old child (girl) was shot by a stray bullet while playing at the door of the Lane community in West, West.
She is now recovering and the police are still pursuing the suspects.
Why we need Simon, Gabby and laurie
That's what I think of this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team for more than one reason.
First, since 1984, I went to every summer Olympics, but the United States has never been a dominant position.
Second, the gymnastics team has three excellent gymnastics, Simon Biles, Gabby Douglas (Douglas Gabby) and laurie Hernández, who have been inspiring many coloured girls.
The composition of the team is very proud of all, because it contains Judaism Ali Raisman (Aly Raisman) and the Catholic 的 Kocian (Catholic).
The team finally looked like the United States team.
It also consolidates the peak of black and Latino women in the campaign.
In the past four years, the leading female gymnast has been African.
Last year, Simon and Gabby were ranked first and second.
It's too bad.
In the last Olympic Games, gaby Douglas, "unexpectedly," became the Olympic champion, and the United States was cheered.
Today, the world is able to witness the brilliant performance of the three world champions Simon Biles, Douglas and laurie Hernández.
On Thursday, Simon helped the American team to achieve fourth on the women's individual Almighty project.
Her teammate Ali Raisman made the silver medal.
We have reached the top of the campaign, but this is not the case in the system-wide teaching classroom.
Simon, Gabby and laurie entered the Olympic team in the same way as Ali and Madison.
They are the ultimate five group, because the next Olympic gymnastics team will be composed of four gymnastics, which is the last year of pre-service.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a costly exercise. gymnastics are mainly trained in private gymnastics clubs, whose parents need to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (including related costs for coaches and gymnastics and family members), and the cost list is increasing.
Most of the gymnastics clubs are located in the rich suburbs that can support the industry.
All the training of the gymnast is done at these clubs and is a long and expensive expense for the gymnastics family.
Biles's coach, Amy Boorman, and Hernandez's coach, Maggie Haney, have been teaching them since the two gymnastics began to teach them.
We must bring more affordable and more accessible gymnastics to countless young girls who have been affected by Simon, Gabby and laurie.
Twenty years ago, I set up my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we offered free and cheap gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youth, mainly black and Hispanic, in the black residential area, and developed national and even world champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this learning opportunity and will benefit from this great Olympic campaign.
Gymnastics helps to build the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, and helps to build hard spirit, self-discipline and determination.
These can provide lifelong benefits for a person's health, education and success.
Inspired by the team, thousands of young girls will study gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in the campaign is significant, especially for girls.
This is an exciting moment.
Thanks to Simon, Ali, laurie, Gabby and Madison for the wonderful "Girl Power" in winning a gold medal in the Olympic Games, and for encouraging so many young girls of different backgrounds to open the way to health, strength and success.
After dismissing Jeremy Hunt's proposal, the junior doctor plans to launch a further strike
The ministers initially hoped to end the change dispute by accepting a modified contract by the British Medical Association officials, but 58% of the 37,000 junior doctors who voted against the contract were opposed to the contract.
In July, Mr. Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract, saying that the British National Medical Service (NHS) is currently in a "vacuum zone," with a slight delay that undermines the interests of employees and patients.
The new contract first referred to the revision of the night and weekend working practices of primary doctors in order to improve the care of irregular working hours.
Last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA primary Committee, said in a statement: "Primary doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially fear that it will exacerbate the current labor crisis and do not treat all doctors fairly."
There is only eight weeks left for the first doctors to sign a new contract, and we need to make progress.
BMA tried to settle the dispute through negotiations, but everyone was reluctant to participate, and sometimes the government was silent.
Nevertheless, last month we received the promise of Jeremy Hunt, who said his door was always open.
"jeremy Hunt now needs to take action to cancel enforcement and address the concerns of primary doctors."
If he did not, the primary doctor made it clear that they were ready to take further labour action.
The last strike took place at the end of April, leading to an extension of nearly 13,000 routine and 100,000 cases, as nurses and consultations were covered by a doctor in the picket.
The ministers initially hoped to end the disputes dispute by accepting the BMA contract.
BMA wants to get a better weekend wage for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of the NHS, called on the primary doctor to stop any further strikes.
"there is little labour action, but on the contrary, putting pressure on the ranks and services that have already been devoted to the fear, anxiety and confusion of patients, caregivers and their families," Mr. Mortimer said.
Over the past two months, we have continued to negotiate with the Committee of Primary Doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and other departments, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and reporting.
Employers wish to continue to actively explore other important topics, such as deployment, flexibility in training, other training for those who have been heavy after career breaks, training costs, common understanding of curriculum outlines, refresher leave and gender pay differences in the medical field, which show the importance of employers, the England Health Education Organization (England) and the Ministry of Health in November, February and May.
Two pounds a day can reduce the threat of heart attack
Officials suggested that a drug of 2 pounds a day be extended to more patients and to prolong the medication, and thousands of patients with heart disease would benefit from the drug.
抗 medicine can reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence in patients with heart disease.
The use of this drug for 12 months after a heart attack can reduce the risk of a stroke or a heart attack.
The National Health and Clinical optimization Institute (national) of the UK National Health Service (NHS) recommended that patients continue to take medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of heart vascular disease.
But now, NHS, the NHS regulator, recommends that patients continue to take medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of heart vascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease every year, and a quarter of them will continue to suffer from a heart attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the formation of plaque in the artery deposition of fatty substances.
If the plaque breaks out, it leads to thrombosis, which prevents blood flow into the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the thrombosis moves, it will enter the bloodstream, hinder blood flow into the brain, causing a stroke.
Patients who have experienced a heart attack have a higher risk of a heart attack.
替 is manufactured by British AstraZeneca, a British company, for sale in Brilique (Brilique), which can reduce the risk of morbidity by reducing the formation of thrombosis.
The draft NICE guidance issued today recommends that patients take 90 mg of fluticasone for 12 months, and take 60 mg of ticagrelor and two aspirin per day for three years.
"in spite of effective secondary prevention, as many as a quarter of those who have a heart disease can again or stroke again, often with serious consequences," said Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre.
The fear of recurrence has a great negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
The evidence shows that taking ticagrelor with aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients who have experienced heart attacks.
We are heartened by the fact that the temporary recommendation for ticagrelor will provide more treatment options for thousands of beneficiaries.
Owing to the limited information on the efficacy and safety of 替 after three years, especially the risk of bleeding, the draft guidance does not recommend the continuation of its treatment after this period.
Computer culture makes "electoral fraud" in the Muslim area
Rahman, a former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was dismissed as a result of corruption last year, prompting the publication of a government report.
The "political correctness" culture has turned a blind eye to the widespread electoral fraud in the Muslim community, a destructive government report that is so today.
Sir Eric Pickles, a former cabinet minister, accused the police, electoral regulators and town hall of evidence of the abuse of elections as a result of "excessive of racial division and religious issues."
The former Minister of Community Affairs, the current anti-corruption minister, said the practice of intimidating voters with religious positions was bad, and the police should be allowed to set up a cordon outside the polling stations to protect the frightened voters.
He suggested that voters carry their identity documents when they vote in order to confirm their identity.
Currently, voters only need to report their names and addresses.
The report even suggested with ink on the voters' fingers to prevent a second ballot.
Sir Eric said that the protection of whistle-blowers should be increased.
He called for increased media access to parliamentary documentation and the decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"this is not just to prevent election fraud, but also to protect local governments from a widespread culture of corruption and the poisoning of financial fraud with which they are closely linked," he said.
The report was called for in Downing Street after the Tower election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that there had been a series of corrupt and illegal acts in 任, a mayor, and should be dismissed.
The court found that Rahman "abused" the religious feelings of the Muslim community and was silent about his allegations of racial discrimination and Islamophobia.
Said was said to have claimed to vote for him as a religious duty of a loyal Muslim during his campaign.
As many as 300 votes are in doubt, it may be the voters counterfeit others to vote.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of electoral fraud throughout the country.
He was particularly alert to the posting of electoral fraud, and senior members of the Muslim community were said to put pressure on voters to force them to vote for their designated candidates.
Sir Eric ((in photos) gave a number of recommendations on the clearance mechanism, including the identification of identity documents to confirm their identity
"the evidence shows that senior members, especially those in Pakistan and Bangladesh background communities, have put pressure on vulnerable groups in some minority communities, especially women and young people, to vote on their own will."

Provision is made for the use of English only in the polling stations (except for the Welsh region).

The world is dangerous, but the video on the Dailymail.com may give you a sense of security.
We asked Mizrachi Rhon, a master of the 马伽术 Alliance in New York, to learn about how to deal with the perpetrators of the gun.
Whether he is from the front or behind you, the video will teach you how to win.
If says if the gunman is close to you, the first thing you have to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and "clear the line of fire."
Then, hold the gun with your forearm and shoulder, and then hit the attacker with your elbow.
Then, with his knee 顶, when the attacker bent down with pain, he turned the gun in his hand, beat his face with the barrel and the reserve, and kept his arms at him.
If the gunman is close to the front, a similar technique is used to keep your body out of the line of fire, grab a gun and reverse the gun so that the gunman can't fire.
At the same time, the weight was pressed on the gun and struck the attacker's chest and reverse the gun from his clenched hand, and then directed the gun to him.
That sounds complicated?
Look at the video and see what Mizrachi did.
But remember, if you are not master, the safest way to get out of the robbery is to hand over cash.
A rogue family destroyed a low-rent house in 康沃尔郡索尔塔什 before being expelled
A rogue family who had been expelled for intimidating his neighbour had destroyed the low-rent house in which he had lived before leaving, causing a loss of 50000.
After a long list of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and his husband, Shaun Trebilcock, were driven out of a low-rent house in 康沃尔郡索尔塔什.
After being forcibly removed from the house, housing officials were surprised to find that there had been serious damage.
There was a hole in the wall, the floor was torn, and the rubbish was thrown all over the ground, and the walls were with.
After being expelled, the family has been moving, and is said to be living in a private home
她 housing, a housing manager at Cornwall Housing Association, said she was worried that the house could not be saved.
"it's a nightmare for people living here," she said. "I don't think people can live like this," she said.
There are many things that need to be weighed, because the house is likely to be a not element.
The family is notorious, and their names are equally notorious.
The couple had three sons, who would stay here from time to time, the police said the terrorist acts of the family included fighting in the streets, threatening nearby residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, 大喊大叫, quarrel, and cursed.
In June, the 47 tenant, Skeldon Skeldon, received a resolution on anti-social behavior.
In the house that is likely to be demolished, many of the rooms are a long time of garbage
The floor was lifted up in the room where the drug had been traded
Neighbors said they often saw them fighting in the streets and often called the police
The Cornwall Housing Association forced her to remove her husband with her husband this week after the 11 extension was given to them voluntarily.
At last, the neighbors cheered, saying that the previous life was a hell of hell.
"they don't care about anyone," said a neighbor.
We lived next to them for 20 years, and we have been so bad.
We've seen the police on countless occasions.
"we can't sleep this morning."
We got up early, because it was so quiet that we were not used to it!
They're so good at the end.
Adam housing, the community executive manager of the Cornwall Housing Association, said the family was not able to cooperate with the local government.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, and the police often visited
Garbage and old toys were thrown on the side of the low-rent house
He added: "It is regrettable that the tenant did not have any responsibility for the conduct of her family, and that expulsion was the final consideration of the Cornwall Housing Association."
This is a very difficult case, because their actions are extremely extreme, and their actions must have made the neighbors feel fearful.
I thank my team for the work done, and I would like to thank the police and the members of the community who were brave enough to provide us with information.
I hope that this will bring some comfort to our neighbours and convey the message that we are not tolerant of anti-social behaviour.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said their three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were in their 20s.
After they were removed, a dirty mattress was thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms
Housing workers will soon clean up the piles of rubbish around the house
In 2014, the police searched the house, found more than 70 grams of cannabis and also found balance, drug use and 1,700 cash.
After he pleaded guilty, Skeldon was fined for holding B drugs and drug trafficking.
She claims that the money was used to buy a tombstone for his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is understood that, after homelessness, Tanya and his husband are now living in a private house in Plymouth.
The house was filled with graffiti on the walls of the house.
Police say they will expel tenants who disobey the tenants' rules.
Angela and Cornwall Crow, of the Cornwall police station, said the expulsion sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to defy the tenants' rules.
"this warning is directed at those who believe that their actions are not charged, and those who have been devastated by such acts," she said.
Devon and Cornwall do not tolerate crime and anti-social behaviour, and they will continue to work together to protect our communities.

The French court dismissed the petition for the demolition of shops in the jungle camps
A French court rejected a petition by the Government of Calais to dismantle dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the "camp, which currently lives in thousands of refugees.
At the Court's hearing this week, the Government of Calais argued that the French government should have the power to dismantle a total of 72 makeshift shops in the camp. People in the camps sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, provide hairdressing services, sell tea at 50 cents (40) in makeshift restaurants or sell basic meals at a price of a few euros.
The office of the Governor of Calais believes that these places should be dismantled because they are not parallel economies, as well as fire and health hazards.
The humanitarian community has stated to the Court that these shops and restaurants are extremely important, as the free food provided by national associations and other groups is simply unable to meet the needs of the growing refugees in the camp.
They say these makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the operator of the 72 temporary shops, but said the concerns of the Governor of Calais were "completely understandable."
The role of these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants is far more than simply providing food to refugees who live in extremely dangerous conditions.
He said these places were a calm point of convergence between refugees and volunteers.
One of the threats to be demolished was the "Jungle Book Kids" cafe in the camp, which provided 200 food, English and French classes per day, and offered shelter advice to hundreds of unaccompanied and vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, closing the cafe "will be a great disaster for these children (a lot of children are only eight years old)."
The two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des, predicted Friday that the number of refugees in the jungle camps has exceeded 9,000, the highest level since the surge in the number of refugees in summer.

Xiamen girl Zhang: "hand Beauty" the road to start shooting the road to the "reverse"
A few days ago, Zhang Donghong, the Xiamen 东园村 of Xiamen, had just changed his home 29 inches of old television to a 65 TV.
The daughter of the ordinary farmer was Zhang Binbin on the evening of the 11th night for China to win a silver medal for the women's 50 rifles in the Rio Olympic Games.
On the night of the 11 th night, before the new television, Zhang Donghong and dozens of relatives, together with dozens of relatives, witnessed their daughter's up, from almost the Heat to the magic process that almost reversed.
On the same day, Zhang Binbin was in the middle and middle of the world, and seemed to be far away from the final.
But parents and friends did not give up, not 刷着, and saw that with the other players finish, Zhang Binbin's ranking, eventually locked the final seat, his home suddenly erupted from a 一阵.
In the final, Zhang Binbin was at one point after one, the last few shots, the more stable, only to win the silver medal by the behind champion of 0.2 rings.
Zhang Binbin, 27, this year, in the 16 years of shooting, in fact, almost a few times with the hard-won silver medal.
Bruce, his mother, told reporters that, when they hesitated, Zhang Binbin found several "small lobbyists" in the village.
These "small" were fellow children who were also recommended for training at the same time, including a cousin of Binbin Binbin.
Shortly after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once again returned to the school of 翔安 because of the difficulties of the family.
But after his initial coach Zhang Piagetian worked repeatedly, Zhang Binbin returned to the Xiamen team.
After entering the provincial team, Zhang Binbin, who had been late for the national team, had once again returned to his home because of no hope.
This time, not only Zhang Piagetian coach, the Xiamen shooting archery movement center and the Fujian province team leaders and coaches came home, and finally persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team.
Like yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl's use insisted on the reverse of the shooting path.
"each coach chose the team differently, when I saw that Binbin's hand was very beautiful.
Zhang Donghong also recalled that in the training test, the daughter is not the best, but the 环数 is very stable, and this is the important reason why Zhang Binbin attracts the coach.
In the course of the training of Zhang Binbin, Zhang Piagetian was the most impressed by the peasant girl's input.
He recalled that Zhang Binbin entered the Xiamen shooting team more than a year later, and the team carried out a 立 lasting training and asked the team to be unable to move for half an hour.
Zhang told reporters that her daughter had been a quiet and quiet child, and she liked to draw and make homemade handmade toys from a young age.
"i'm going to make clothes and planting at home, and Binbin will pick up some scrap to make a doll."
She says her daughter often makes her own handmade toys, and that she is good at drawing, from the doll's features to clothes, and can always be lifelike.
As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and his family gather more and less, only holidays will be able to go home, often by telephone contact.
Parents say that, whether to meet or call, Zhang Binbin seldom said his own hard work, more of the parents to talk about fun.
When she was not able to see her daughter, his parents were kept in the home with the paintings of her daughter and the honour of the calendar year.
Xiao Zhang shows her daughter's cartoon paintings to reporters. "If there is no shooting athlete, she should continue to paint."
On the second floor of Zhang Binbin, there was a cabinet filled with medals, medals and certificates.
Zhang Donghong put the medals and medals neatly, and the certificates are kept in the folder. "These are the honor of the Binbin for more than a decade, and we all cherish.

The mainland diamond sales are now referred to as three major problems, including the up of the 虚标 diamond clarity, the weight of the diamond and the of after, according to Hong Kong's East Daily Daily.
In Antwerp, as one of the world's largest diamond trading centres, the diamond cutting technology of the local artisans, the diamonds sold were strictly identified and welcomed by the Mainland.
"a small bag, held in the palm of the hand, a small 撮 of light, worth nearly $1 million," Liu name, a participation, describes her experience in Antwerp in June.
She said she hid the diamonds in her underwear, and went to the toilet and the shower for a long time, and she was very nervous about walking.
She said the diamond bought in Antwerp was about $5,000 per carat, and the price of the same quality diamonds in Xiamen was about $1,000.
She had sold all the diamonds, and had made two hundred thousand dollars a year.
According to the customs regulations of the Mainland, the goods or necessities of the travel of diamonds are in the category of goods, which are required to declare, otherwise or be smuggled, the situation can be sentenced to imprisonment.

China's Mars program has come
The mission of Mars in our country needs to be surrounded, landed and inspected at one time, and this form has never been passed abroad.
My country's Mars detection target is a step around, landing, and visiting, the task is very difficult.
As the Mars probe is 26 months to meet a time window, experts are working closely on the project to launch our country's first Mars probe in 2020.
According to Xu 达哲, despite the fact that our spacecraft has entered deep space, the completion of the Mars exploration mission is indispensable, and the detection of Mars means that China is actually entering the era of deep space exploration.
"once every two or three years, Mars has a recent opportunity to launch a Mars probe at this point in time, which is the most energy source for the launch vehicle."
"taking into account the quality of the Mars detector, it will be carried out by our country's Long March launch vehicle.
My country's Mars exploration mission must be surrounded, landed and inspected at a time, and this form has never been done abroad, and it was proposed to be surrounded and landed abroad, but the landing failed.
Most of the technical areas involved in Mars detection are that, while Rover is a space detector, it has distinctive features compared to the general space detector.
In other words, the Mars probe will have the ability to determine the route and detect the obstacles.
Pang researchers, a researcher of the Chinese Space Science and Technology Group, said human beings are so popular with Mars because it has important scientific and technological implications, and even the future of human beings.
Now Mars has become the planet with the highest level of human research beyond Earth, and the history of human use of space detectors for Mars is almost across the entire human race.
As a result, humanity hopes to build a residence base on Mars one day, and eventually move to Mars and turn it into the second home of human beings.
There is a great deal of evidence that Mars is likely to be, like the present planet, only after billions of years of evolution to become thin, low temperatures and water depletion.
As a result, research on detection or manned landing on Mars can provide a plan to prevent the planet from becoming the second Mars that is difficult to survive.
As of June 2016, a total of 114 lunar exploration and 43 Mars surveys were conducted worldwide.
However, from the 1990s to the present, human beings carried out 18 Mars probes, while lunar exploration was carried out only 14 times.
Currently, five Mars orbiter and 2 Mars rover are working, but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are working.
The world's space-faring nations have developed a detection plan aimed at the Mars system, which shows that today's Mars detection is hotter than the lunar probe.
On 5 November 2013, India launched the first Mars probe "Mangalyaan," the first country in Asia to successfully detect Mars.
"Mangalyaan" is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars, and to explore whether there is methane and signs of life on Mars.
The most difficult place for this task is that the probe enters the Martian atmosphere with only one chance of slowdown and parachute slowdown
The Mars Reconnaissance mission faces many technical challenges, according to Sun 泽洲, chief designer of the Mars detectors of the five of China's Space Science and Technology Group.
The atmospheric pressure of Mars is very low, and only 1% of the Earth's surface pressure is highly uncertain.
Scientists do not have a thorough understanding of factors such as its changes and the characteristics of the storm.
In summer, Mars often produces dust storms similar to the dust of the earth, which will lead to a sharp drop in the sun's solar energy, which must be designed for Rover to wait patiently for the dust storm.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reduction in solar light, which poses a challenge for the energy supply of Mars.
This requires the detectors of the probe to be larger, and it needs to be constantly adjusted to work towards the direction of the sun.
Also, the surface of Mars is only 38% of the Earth, but more gravity than the surface of the moon, so the detector needs more power.
"the most central and difficult place for the Mars exploration mission is that the probe enters the Martian atmosphere in the process of pneumatic and parachute, with only one chance to ensure success."
According to Sun 泽洲, because the Earth is far from Mars, the entire process cannot be controlled by the ground in real time, so it is necessary to rely on the detector to complete it independently.
As there is less propellant to offset that high speed, the slowdown depends on the effects of the Martian atmosphere when landing on Mars, but the Martian atmosphere is difficult to simulate on the ground.
Overall said, in general, the way to detect Mars is similar to that of the moon, "around, fell, drinks, back," and ultimately the goal of manned landing on Mars.
As Mars is far away from the Earth than the moon, the detection of Mars needs to overcome a series of more complex technical difficulties.
According to Taiwan's media, the "President of the Administration" announced yesterday morning that "the regulations on the improper acquisition of property by political parties and their accompanying organizations" came into effect today.
Kuomintang Deputy, vice president of the Kuomintang, said, "The Kuomintang, which has a history of more than a hundred years, has a social commitment and responsibility, not to fail."
Deforestation emphasizes that if the political party, the accompanying organization or the trustee are in violation of the prohibitions imposed by the regulations, the Commission will investigate ex officio and "according to the law."
Deforestation also announced the misconduct of the Party Committee, which will be held by the "Deputy Director of Agency" Hong Kong.
He said that account 担任, who was the misconduct Committee of the misconduct Committee, was not a candidate, and borrowed the experience of the relevant major cases in the past, and would serve as the basis for the Commission to take stock of the relevant cases.
Zhan believes that today, as long as there is a party, no one will give you a social contribution, and if the party has been confiscated, the Kuomintang can just ask for social support and sponsorship.
Zhan also stressed that, even after the not regulations were on the road, the Kuomintang party had not been completely confiscated and confiscated, and the rest would be promised to donate it to the party, and the Party would have to start from scratch.
Original title: "Corridor Doctor" Lan v. CCTV moderator Wang andy against honour violations
Law moderator, the CCTV presenter Wang andy, published a speech on the "corridor" event on Sina Weibo, Lan will Wang andy and Beijing 微梦 Techtronic Network Technology Co. Ltd. v. the Court.
Yesterday afternoon, the Haidian Court handed down a judgement in the case, which found that Wang andy and 微梦 not did not constitute a violation and rejected all of Lan's claims.
At the beginning of 2014, CCTV reporter Wang andy found that although Lan 的 in the hospital corridor was shaped by the media as a H hero of the system, there is a lot of false information on these reports.
On 29 March 2014, the CCTV News Survey produced the "corridor Doctor" programme.
There is no evidence to support the various types of so-called information reported to the media by Lan.
Wang andy, also in the real Weibo, describes the "character of Lan, with obvious 的 personality."
Lan asked Wang to remove Weibo, apologize to him and compensate for the moral damage of $100,000.
At the time of the hearing, the two sides carried out a debate on whether Wang andy had violated the reputation of Lan.
Point Kasai China 
The bicycle is expected to achieve a "zero breakthrough" for the Olympic gold medal, while women's girls will challenge two world champion German teams, looking forward to off.
Wang 镇近's two seasons are prominent, and last year's World Championships in Beijing won a silver medal in the World Championships in May.
Zhang reports, 27, won a gold medal in the women's archery personal race, and the Olympic gold medal after the group race.
Zhang Chun was thought to be a late player who regretted that she had not been admitted to the last London Olympics and was now proud to stand on the top podium of the Rio Olympics.
Zhang Lo won the gold medal in the Women's archery individuals Final in the Avenue Stadium in Brazil.
She first shot at the fourth grade of primary school, until the first gold medal in the World Cup tournament in 2014 was a players player.
"there was no level before secondary school to be able to participate in the national competition," Zhang Lo recalled.
Zhang Lo was only fourth in the London Olympic Games in the London Olympic Games four years ago, and only a colleague and friend, 奇甫倍, took two gold medals.
Zhang Lo spoke of his taken speech at the end of the women's archery individual award ceremony, "until the end of the day is to shoot archery as much as possible, which may have brought good results and contentment.
28 奇甫倍, 28, won the bronze medal in the London Olympic Games archery individual gold medal winner.
奇甫倍 lost to Zhang Lo in the semi-final, with a bronze medal with Mexico's players Valencia.
奇甫倍 to ensure that the bronze of the bronze in the field, during which it is conceivable that the hedge burden can be borne in silence.
First, the team has accumulated rich experience in continuous research, followed by scientific training, which need to be accumulated over the long term.
The archery team helps the team to focus and stay normal by means of military training and night crossing of the cemetery.
Despite the fact that it has not been confirmed, many news sources say Apple's fall in 2016 will be held in September, and iPhone7 is really coming.
Although Apple has not responded, the new iPhone's functions and configurations have been released, even on the Internet.
The new generation of iPhone is "attention," hot, tight, and there. If you want to buy the real goods first, you must choose a good channel, like, Suning.
This has exacerbated the disappointment of new mobile phones, "it has been extended, but no holographic images can be projected!" The iPhone is worse. "
IPhone7, like the other iPhone, is accompanied by countless anecdotes.
In addition, there are a number of sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will cancel the 3.5 mm headphones interface to a Bluetooth connection and charging interface, which will provide a space for Apple to add a second speaker.
Another evidence to support the news is that in 2014 Apple allowed headphones to produce headphones products connected to the charging interface.
These messages are either real or false, the answer will not be known until Apple's fall in the fall of 2016.
But this does not prevent the industry from looking at the prospect of iPhone7 - many believe that iPhone7 will be likely to be the last big upgrade of Apple's iPhone series.
The market share of the iPhone has declined, despite the recent data published by market IDC.
Among them, Goldman maintained the "buy" rating of Apple's shares, while BMO analysts believed that iPhone7 would reap a historic sales record.
At the same time, Botong CEO, CEO of Botong, also said Apple's future revenue increase would be more than 20%, and this would benefit entirely from the launch of iPhone7.
Seven% of respondents indicated that they had the intention of buying iPhone7, and only 4% of the number of people planned to buy iPhone6 two years ago.
It is understood that 20% of the user groups currently holding iPhone6 or 6 are planning to purchase iPhone7, a fairly high proportion.
Second, there is an expert analysis that most of the Apple prefer skipped-generation to change their iPhone.
According to statistics, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their mobile phones for two years, or about 120 million users have been using the iPhone for two years.
According to the media, there were several earthquakes in Taiwan during the production of iPhone7, "tSMC production facilities have been damaged beyond imagination and may have an impact on the initial iPhone7 supply."
The contradiction of supply and demand can affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time to start the real iPhone7.
According to people familiar with the matter, in the near future, Suning senior and Apple have met frequently in order to prepare for sufficient supplies, according to people familiar with the matter.
The operator has already negotiated with Suning, and it is foreseeable that, with the depth of cooperation between the two sides, it is bound to bring lower prices and more intimate services to the user.
"at the lowest price, the consumer may be able to buy iPhone7 for only seven yuan a day."
Adequate supply and variety of preferences, so that the purchase of the iPhone7 is no longer "pressure mountains," and the Suning logistics will make it more intuitive.
Maybe you'll get a phone call in the middle of the night, "Hello, Suning patchy, your iPhone7 is coming."
The organizers hope to make the local people more aware of a long history of Chinese culture, thereby enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.

According to media, the "Green Pool" of the Rio Olympics has recently attracted attention since the diving pool from blue to green.
However, on the morning of 10 morning, water in the water polo pool adjacent to the diving pool became green.
The Australian polo player said he had a sting in his eyes and tried to shed tears after the match.
In the past, the officials of the Rio Olympics confirmed the become of the pool of water and said that the water of the pool was due to the alkaline of the alkaline, which did not affect the physical health of the athletes.
But the Australian athlete, after winning a game with the Japanese team in the water polo pool, said his eyes were tingling.
As early as the diving pool was green, the organizers were working on the diving pool on the evening of 9 p.m., but it was found that the color of the water polo pool had changed rapidly on the morning.
The environmental conditions of the water polo pool gradually deteriorated during the competition between Australia and Japan, but officials stressed that they would return the water quality of the two swimming pools to the original color on 11 November.
"the water alkaline level in the diving pool was first weaker yesterday afternoon," said Andrada Andrada, a spokesman for the Rio Olympic Games.
"we are aware of a range of causes that may trigger the color of the pool and the containing of water quality."
Water sports centres carried out a series of tests of water quality, and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the pool to determine the quality of water quality. "
"we have been taking normal procedures these days, but we may lose sight of the more possible impact of athletes on water quality."
"but the change in the color of water must have no effect on health, especially for athletes."
"this independent team has confirmed our assessment and the measures we have taken to restore normal color and normal chemistry to the swimming pool.
"we would have hoped that the swimming pool would return to normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected by the rain.

Urumqi norms tourism market travel must contract
At present, Xinjiang has entered the tourist season, in order to regulate the market business order of the tourism industry, and the Urumqi law enforcement team in the city of Urumqi, the enforcement law enforcement team, did not regulate the tourist car in the FIT market yesterday.
At eight o'clock yesterday morning, around 10 bus were parked around the Kempinski Hotel, most of which were the 散客团 of a day trip to Lake Tianchi.
"hello, I'm the Urumqi Tourist Board. You signed the contract with this travel agency?"
Relocation enforcement, a staff member of the enforcement law enforcement team, said: "relocation travel cars and cars in the Urumqi market operate tourist passenger projects, without qualification."
"out-of-scope runs a fine of three to 100,000 of this penalty, and the driver does not have a certificate of employment is a fine of 2,000 yuan."
It is understood that the Urumqi tourism law enforcement department had conducted inspections of the areas of the tourism industry, such as West Park and Hongshan.

"we, together with tubal, continue to inspect the market and regulate the travel of travel agents to ensure the safety of tourists."
On the morning of 12 August, the State Council Office held a press conference on the functioning of the national economy in July 2016.
National information, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics and the Director of the Integrated National Statistics Division, said that in July, the economic component of the national economy slowed down, but still operated in a reasonable range.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics show that data on the growth of fixed assets and total imports in July have fallen.
With regard to the functioning of the national economy in July, I would like to borrow from the Prime Minister a word "shape, potential,," which can provide a better overview of the economic performance of July.
He explained that "shape" means that the growth of some economic indicators in July is indeed a decline.
As the economy is still in deep adjustment in July, the international situation is complex and volatile, and the world economy recovers less than expected, so the export pressure is still larger.
In the domestic context, the economy is still at the critical stage of adjustment, the pain of the adjustment is released, the economy is facing low downward pressure, so some of the indicators are somewhat volatile.
Full pointed out that there was a special situation in July, where floods were more serious, and the high temperature and hot weather had some impact on the production and operation of some areas.
According to the recent release of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people in the country have been affected by a direct economic loss of over 200 billion yuan.
In terms of industrial, investment and transport-related indicators, these areas have been affected to varying degrees.
In July, the volume of cargo turnover rose 3.6 percentage points from last month, and the floods had a certain impact on the traffic in these areas.
From these factors, the volatility of some of the indicators in July was also normal and expected.
"potential is still good," he said, is that, despite the decline in economic growth, the economy is running smoothly, and there is no change in the is and stability of the economy.
The CPI rose by 1.8% in July, and the ring rose by 0.2%, and the price situation was generally stable.
According to the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau portal, the statistics of high temperature weather in each district, except Youyang, the rest of our city can receive a different degree of high temperature allowance.
Currently, at least 28 provinces in the country have identified the criteria for the payment of allowances, although the standards are not the same in the provinces, while Chongqing receives a high temperature allowance on a high basis.
At 35 °C above 37 °C, it is issued at no less than $10 per person per day; above 37 °C, it is issued at no less than $15 per person per day.
Above 40 °C, high temperature staff may receive a maximum of 20 yuan / day allowance per month (with the exception of the worker's allowance for high temperature jobs in accordance with the law).
According to this standard, the most high temperature days in the last month were able to receive 330 yuan and the lowest number of days was 80 yuan, while the highest temperature rate was not met by the high temperature.
In the past, a number of units would offset the high temperature allowance with cool drinks, and the city said it was not in line with the current approach.
The employer shall not deduct or reduce the wages of the worker due to the suspension of work and shorter working hours due to high temperature weather.
According to misers, the employee has not received a high temperature allowance at high temperature, but can seek legal rights or appeal to the 12333 in the labor dispute mediation agency in which the enterprise is located.
If the employer refuses to issue a high temperature allowance, the worker may lodge a complaint with the competent department of human resources social security at the county level or above.
At the same time, because the high temperature allowance is part of the wage, it is not a welfare, to be included in the total wage and the deduction of a tax.
As a result, the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage and must be issued in a cash form and cannot be replaced with beverages such as beverages.
The newly built Urumqi station is located in the Urumqi high-speed rail area, with a total building area of about 100,000 square metres.
The first and second floors of the ground are on the ground floor, waiting room and office, business premises, and the first floor of the ground.
At present, Urumqi station is the largest integrated transport hub in Xinjiang, with high-speed rail, rail traffic, bus, rental and so on.
At the north and south sides of the platform, there are three ticket on the north side of the platform and the north side of the outbound layer, with 39 manual ticket windows and 34 automatic.
With regard to the ticket, there are 30 channels on both sides of the waiting hall, and passengers can check and wait for the waiting room according to the ticket number on the ticket.
If you need help, you can choose the 41 call buttons set up within the station, and can be provided with timely service.
From July 1, the old station, the passenger train from the Urumqi South station, took a step to the Urumqi station.
In other words, all train and 30 对 trains can stop at Urumqi.
At present, both stations can buy tickets, the train between them for about 10 minutes, passengers need to pay attention to the specific standing name of the face and the terminal.
The formal operation of the new Urumqi station in Urumqi will be an important platform for Xinjiang to build a national comprehensive transportation city and promote the construction of the "Silk Road Economic Belt" and the New Area.
Gracian is a lucas female toucans, with the breath of a tropical rain forest.
In the Central American countries, Costa Rica, the toucans bird Gracian and its story are well known.
At a press conference on August 10, the Gracian, who was recovering from surgery, showed his new 3D print plastic bird.
It was a year and a half before the beak, the dying bird, now finally regained new life.
This day not only proclaims that it has recovered 100% of its health, but it is the day that it moves into a luxury birdhouses and meet with human friends who care about it.
The Gracian of the new home was slightly shy, but it became lively, roll in the water basin, and ate grapes with a new beak.
To remind people about the damage it had suffered, technicians did not paint their new beak, but retained the original white of 3D printing materials.
The bird's beak is a thin layer of horny, inside hollow, only a few thin bone support rods staggered.
Despite this internal reinforcement, the beak of the toucans bird is fragile and broken when it is hurt.
The Animal Rescue Centre, the birds physicists and an American 3D printing company worked together to produce several "test" for Gracian, and finally made the "perfect beak" that is best suited to it.
Now Gracian has been able to use a new beak to drink water, eat, and even pick up small grains.

Core tips: Japan's companies, in particular, is wary of the rise of China's small independent refinery, known as the "teapot."
"china's export expansion is one of the reasons for the downturn, according to media, the largest oil company in Japan.
Japan, in particular, is wary of the rise of China's small independent refinery, known as the "teapot."
The quality of China's oil products is gradually approaching Japanese oil because of the Chinese government's tightening of environmental regulations.
Before obtaining the import license for crude oil, the "teapot refinery" generally imported heavy oil from Russia, such as Russia, with high sulphur content.
The production of petroleum products with high sulfur content and poor oil, is one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining an import licence for crude oil, the "teapot refinery" can import 阿曼产 crude oil and Russian crude oil, and the quality of its petroleum products has also increased.
"the capacity of refining equipment has also increased as the standard of quality of petroleum products in China is increasing.
As a result, China's exports of petroleum products have gradually reached the same level as Japan (the world's highest quality).
"after the end of 2015, China began to export high-quality 的 to Australia" and compete with Japanese products in the Asian market.
Although Japan's high oil is facing a crisis, Japan's companies strategy is only "to focus on the market and export to areas where there is a profit."
Because China's exports of petroleum products have a huge impact on the Asian market, the attention of the teapot refinery is becoming more and more high.

In some nights, the ionosphere is full of free electrons, which means that radio signals can go further.
The United States Air Force is interested in replicating this effect, according to the monthly website on August 11.
Although a stable mass of free electrons can help people listen to the radio station on the margins of a university radio station, this may not be the interest of the United States Air Force.
The ionosphere, which is full of electrons, means that the military uses a larger range of radio, and it may provide some protection for global positioning systems (GPS) signals from solar storms.
The ultimate goal may be to create a series of cube based on demand, which can strengthen the ionosphere when needed.
But first, these teams with the Air Force must prove that the scientific principle will work.
Industry data show that the total size of coal capacity in 2015 is close to 6 billion tons, and the country's coal capacity has been in excess of 1.8 billion tons.

These three surface factors reflect the fact that the relative lag in our growth approach in the past is that the Government growth approach has not yet been fundamentally transformed.
Second, it is also directly related to the advancement of local governments, and in the process of 去产能, funds and corresponding measures are in place and, in this regard, the differences in different regions are indeed larger.
Third, if some of the provinces that are currently in a relatively slow pace are going to catch progress in the second half of the year, they may face a greater risk.
In such cases, the process of relying on the central award to advance the 去产能 process could have a negative impact.
First, 去产能 is not simply 进行 control.
Our aim is to reconstruction the structure of the whole coal industry by eliminating backward production capacity, advancing the structure optimization and rebuilding the whole coal industry.
In the process of deploying 去产能, local governments must combine the transformation of the coal industry and coal industry to develop the related services.
Secondly, in order to complete this year's 去产能 mission this year, we should also take full advantage of the power of administrative oversight and administrative supervision.
Finally, we need to strengthen the backstop role of social security.
Because the market directly involves the problem of employment, we need to strengthen employment skills training for employees and employees.

Ning's performance in the 100 freestyle half has made many Chinese viewers speechless.
But in the 50 freestyle, Ning peter once again refresh people's "bottom line."
In fact, the 50 freestyle is not a Ning pillar, and his performance and best grades in Kazan World Championships also determine his chances of making a breakthrough in this project.
Sure enough, Hong Kong's authoritative media, , revealed that the biggest reason for the defeat was that he had lost interest in swimming.
Many of the factors on the sidelines could have had a great influence on his future ideas, and he might be more interested in moving into the entertainment industry.
After the World Championships, Ning peter, with its high 颜值 and good grades, became a 网红 in a moment.
As a result, "national husband," "small meat," "figure," and so on are also labels on him.
All kinds of commercial activities come to the door, good money, become a golden flashing.
In this case, Ning is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly viable path, even if he chooses to retire in the entertainment industry at this time.
After all, he was only 23 years old, and after a certain study, he would be able to play a couple of TV dramas by virtue of his popularity.
But Ning needs to see if, in comparison with these predecessors, do you have enough qualifications?
In the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Liu Xuan, 21, has come to the end of his career.
Liu Xuan's beautiful appearance made her quickly remembered and laid the foundation for her future career in the entertainment industry.
After his retirement, Liu Xuan played a series of TV dramas and set up his own studio in 2013.
Field took part in the two Olympic Games of the 单双人 Decade race, and obtained 2 gold and 2 silver.
But after losing to his teammates in the 2004年 game in the 2004 Olympic Games, the field of the field fell and was ejected from the diving team.
And he and his daughter took a variety show, such as "where Dad went," and he made him earn the eye.
The former gymnastics gold generation, Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng, and Chen 一冰 are all high-profile in various variety programs.
It is worth mentioning that Yang Wei had led China to win the 2008 Olympic Games Artistic, and Yang Wei took the individuals gold medal twice, called Almighty.
Chen 一冰, while leading China to the 2012 Olympic group champion, also became the ring king.
And after the London gold medal in the London Olympics, Chen 一冰's generous move, also made him 圈粉.
But the main energy of the athletes is still in the field, and the variety show is just like a dragonfly some.
But whether they are retired or active in active service, it will be necessary to get the favor of the entertainment industry.
After all, athletes step into a new field, both capacity and networking, is a blank state.
Even the field, Liu Xuan, who through the entertainment industry for many years, the ordinary audience against them, more about their performance in the Olympic Games.
But Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and other new people, the introduction of the variety show, without exception, is "Olympic champion."
Compared to the above, the title of a swimming world championship is still slightly thin.
In addition, compared to the dying, Liu Xuan, Yang Wei, and others, Ning peter, if it is 23 years old and a little setback in sports career, the negative impact on its image is probably immeasurable.
After all, in the case of athletes, people's demands are "not, but in spite of the fear," and the distance is much worse.
After ten thousand steps, Ning is so handsome that it can rely on 颜值 to obtain the support of thousands of brain.
There is no power, only on the appearance, want to be in the entertainment industry, it is not more difficult to get back to the state.
The choice of life is based on individual will, but how to choose, Ning should have a number.

Greenland shark, also known as the small sleep, is widely distributed in the North Atlantic Ocean surrounding Greenland and Iceland, which is 4 to 5 metres long in adulthood.
But they grow very slowly, sometimes about 1 cm for a year, suggesting that Greenland may have a long life expectancy.
Traditional dating methods usually use animals tissues of animals, which can be used in some sharks, but the calcification tissue is very rare in Greenland.
A new study, led by Julius ·, at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, turned to the radioactive measured of the eye lens in Greenland.
This method had previously been used to determine the age of the whale, but it was the first time to determine the age of fish such as sharks.
Their analysis shows that the largest shark life is estimated at 392 years, with an error of 120 years.
This means that the shark is at least 272 years old and is likely to reach 512 years.
In addition, the female 的 shark, who is said to be about 4 metres in length, is mature and converted into age, at least to 156 years of age.
The researchers therefore wrote in the paper that the Greenland shark is a Known and most vertebrate on Earth, exceeding the previous longevity champion right whales (211 years).

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will go to Kenya to attend the sixth African Development Conference in late August, according to the Chinese Voice News late in August.
The African Development Conference, which was led by Japan, had been held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, and would therefore be the first to move to Africa.
In this regard, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan said that local meetings in Africa had helped to raise concerns about Japan in African and European countries.
In response to Abe's visit, the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party will send a group to the countries concerned, according to Kyodo.
Japan's "入常" road began in the early 1990s, and the African Development Conference, launched by Japan, also started in 1993, is not a coincidence!
Africa, with 53 seats in the United Nations, is an important part of the United Nations, and how can Japan want to abandon Africa?
There will also be an exchange of views with national stakeholders on the extremist organization of the Islamic State and the response to terrorist activities.
The Western Group will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau.
Japan's Foreign Minister, Kishida Fumio, has also recently stated his intentions on the African Development Conference in the United Nations Security Council.
Abe has announced here that, for the sake of stability in sub-Saharan African countries, 100 billion yen ($61 billion) will be provided within five years.
Observers generally believe that Japan's generosity towards Africa has been primarily aimed at increasing Japan's sense in Africa; and, on the other hand, to win the support of African countries on the issue of 入常.
"on the political front, Africa, though relatively underdeveloped, has a relatively large number of countries, so Japan has always regarded it as the so-called" big ticket. "
Japan will not give up in the future, and the work on Africa will not be terminated and will continue to be strengthened.
Economic, because Japan has a strong productive capacity, but the domestic market is relatively limited, especially in the context of the ageing of minority, domestic demand is relatively low.
However, from Junichiro Koizumi, 10 years ago, to Abe, 10 years later, Japan has repeatedly launched a 入常 "sprint."
Japanese experts, Yang BOJIANG, believe that Japan's 入常 intentions are clear, but the road to 入常 is bound to be difficult.
Japan is to achieve its own goals, first and foremost with neighbouring countries, in which Japan needs a right attitude, both in geopolitical and ethnic disputes, as well as on historical issues.

Liu Administration stressed that Sanya should seize the opportunity of historical development, and the pilot work of "pair" is an important 抓手, which is the leading role of the model in the economic and social development of the province.

Committee Secretary Zhang Qi, Deputy Governor Wang Road, the provincial government secretary, Land Land, participated in the study.
During the 14 years of his career, Deng Yaping got 18 world champions and became the first to win four Olympic gold medals in the history of China's Olympic Games.
She kept the world in the world for eight years in a row, and was the longest female athlete in the "world's first" ranking.
On 26 September 2010, the Deputy Secretary-General of system and General Manager of the People's Search Network (company), is cadres.
She will work together with Yu Ming to work together to build the first sports industry innovation platform in the country.
China's sports team also has such a group of star coaches: they have won countless glory for the country in the time of the athletes.
As the first world champion of Chinese men's gymnastics, Huang Yubin chose to pick up his pointer.
From the female team coach to the coach, and to the general coach, Huang Yubin created a "Olympic 金团," and the team was more likely to win a myth 1 record in the Beijing Olympic Games.

Many NBA players have proved their strength, but there has been a decline in people's progress.
A number of players will be step every season, either because of their age and the limited time of the appearance.
Of course, some of the "step " may be only the shrinking of data, and the strength of these players may not fall.
Even Wade is one of the best score in the league, but his performance in the bull should not be so good.
He and Rondo have a limited range of back, and households Butler's triple hit rate is only 32.8%, which makes them very crowded next season.
In the city of wind, Flash will have to give ball more to Butler and Rondo, and they are likely to choose a health regimen in the regular season.
Okafor's situation was embarrassing, as the first choice of 76 people last season, he had to compete with Simmons and 恩比德 in the new season to compete for time and ball.
The competition may not come soon, and Simons needs to adapt to the NBA, and 恩比德 will recover from the injury as soon as possible, but it is a problem for Okafor to have a position in the 76 people.
Last season, 32% of the Okafor scored from low attacks, which was higher than DeMarcus, 武切维奇 and Brooklyn, while his use was high on the top 40.
As Simmons has shown an excellent ball forward, 恩比德 also has a better figure for the NBA, and Okafor's position is likely to be hard to stand.
In the last two seasons, Thompson's use rate has stabilized at the top 20 of the league, and this is the best two seasons of his career.
The question, however, is that, with Durant's arrival, Thompson's use is bound to fall, which will inevitably affect his play.
This impact will not only affect the number of shots, but the 汤神的 attack will certainly be reduced in the next season, and in some ways it will be less difficult for him to defend him.
Durant's arrival will make it possible for men players to shrink, but the most serious shrinkage is Thompson.
But this does not mean that the level of 汤神's level step, more like his sacrifice for the team as a whole.
Parker showed better than the data in the last season, not only because his basket efficiency came to the top of his career, and his chemical reaction to Aldridge also benefited the Spurs.
Duncan retired, and Ginobili announced another year of war, and the combination of GDP eventually reached the end, as the youngest of the three people, the French sports car's tank was not much oil.
After getting the third championship ring, only Kareem, Jordan and 拉塞尔比 James won more regular season MVP, while Jordan was the only one who was more than James.
Oh, yes, James has just brought the first professional sports championship trophy for the past 52 years.
James, who came to the 14th season of his career, needed to be better equipped to prepare for the playoffs.
So, in the regular season, James's data is likely to fall further, and he will share more burdens to Owen, but he will still easily become the first three players in the league.

Earlier in the day, the British team had a 7 victory over Africa, which could have affected their status in the final.
But in any case, the current Fiji team is enough to defeat a spirit team.
Tomorrow, at least one Englishman will wear a gold medal, which may be a comfort to the British team, but it may not be.
It is not easy for the British team to achieve today's achievements.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's teaching, they did not taste Law in the 阿德莱得 international football game.
Now, they are just one step away from the championship.
Although they have been badly hit, they have also made remarkable progress.
Fiji took the advantage of the opening, making the British team 毫无.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like a series of is buses. When 欧西 hedge rushed into the flag area, the World Series championship was well ahead of the score.
The game was just four minutes later, and Jerry 图怀 scored a touchdown on the right wing.
At 12 to 0, the British team hardly met the ball.
Mitchell's powerful interdiction did not score a third score for the giant Lyon Lyon, but it was just a slow pace in Fiji's score.

Helen Graf and Heather Stanning, inspired by a cancer coach, won a gold medal in rowing
It is no exaggeration to say that this is the most touching gold medal.
From the first paddle to the present, Helen · and Heather Stanning have accepted 220 punitive 拉举 training, and the gold medal that they won in Estacio da is more remarkable.
Although there were only two of them, the sound of a man on board, coach Robin Williams, had been accompanied by the second consecutive Olympic gold medal, which was the first to reach the height of the rowing.
They have maintained 39 unbeaten records and have an absolute advantage.
What we see is the grace of the two talented athletes on the water, but this is not the whole of this victory.
There is a lot of voluntary help behind every rowing gold medal, and their constant dedication has been created differently than a coach who learned that he had cancer 30 months ago and did not know if he could live to see the day.
As he said, death may come at any time.
I got a bladder cancer, and they operated for me.
If the surgery is not done, the cancer cells are 扩撒 to the whole body.
In this way, the situation would be much worse.
This will change your view slightly.
Williams was diagnosed as cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he began treatment at the beginning of 2014 to minimize the impact, although it might not be appropriate in such cases.
I need to get my salary, so I have to hurry up.
This is an incentive for me.
I live in the hospital, though they say it is enough to take a few steps, but I go around the ward 20 feet, 30 feet and 50 feet.
This is the starting point of everything.
Rowing itself is a journey, which makes the journey a little longer.
At the moment of gold, the first thing they thought of was Williams, who was a little more talkative this morning than usual, to overcome his anxiety.
"i'm in a bad mood this week, maybe a little extreme, but the gold medal is really remarkable," she said.
It has repeatedly told me how important it is for me, and how much I, Helen and Robin have made.
This is Helen, Robin and I have worked hard for three years.
If there is no Robin, we're just a nobody, thank him very much. He's the best coach in the world.
I can't find a better trainer and coach than him.
Helen · and Heather Stanning did not taste defeat in five years.
The penalties imposed on the combination are not comparable to their opponents.
Even in the last 500 meters, Zealand and Denmark began,, and Graf still have a lot of physical reserves.
At that time, it was very exciting.
Helen cried, "Keep pace and keep pace."
It is really important not to be affected by your opponent.
We have a good start, and we are not looking forward to doing something earth-shattering.
We did not think of the glory of today, we just wanted to score each oar and win the game, and we did it.
It took a year to determine its own future.
Graf will marry Steve 巴克沙尔 on TV next month.
But now, she just wants to enjoy the present.
I don't want to say this is my last game.
This will bring me too much pressure.
In London, I spent about six months to realize that I was the Olympic champion.
This is a new experience, and I feel very nervous.
It has been about four minutes now.
"i feel much better," she said.

Snapchat's "animation" effect has been used to ironically the Asian people
Snapchat said the filter was inspired by animation, but some observers thought it was racial.
Snapchat's 150 million daily users can change reality through their filter tools and make people seem funny.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a role painting.
These lenses have the effect of passivation and bending characteristics, producing more than 30 million after self per day.
Any mistake will be immediately noticed by the public.
The Snapchat lens has been criticized, which is used to incite black or white skin.
So, when the application this week provides some users with a filter that can create 斜眼, 怪牙 and face effects, some critics call it racial satire on the "yellow race" in Asia.
They even think that these recurring problems mean that the company has a larger problem in its diversity.
After Snapchat said it had deleted the function, the report on Wednesday, The and and, sparked outrage.
The company's explanation is that the filter is a tribute to the animation role, not the ironically of Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of the vulnerability stereotypes in reality.
Others are firmly opposed to these cartoon images.
A Korean American art, issued and widely shared with the photos, said in an e-mail that these filters are "at least uncomfortable and uncomfortable."
"it is difficult to distinguish between the extreme image of Asia and the effect of the filter," she said.
Although the filter is not only a yellow race, the yellow are extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that touches these cultural lines.
From the company's board to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, American culture seems to be advocating diversity and inclusiveness.
Snapchat's large young group may be very sensitive because of a greater focus on racial diversity than the older generation.
When a filter produced an insult to the user's image, Juba, 25, said in an interview Thursday: "It is more difficult to escape from people than before."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, who was a product manager and engineer in Medium, decided to remove her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article and a telephone interview for Medium, she said she believed that racial disputes reflected the lack of racial diversity in the recruitment process.
Ms. Zhu criticism that the company's employees are mostly white, the leadership is all men and a label is added at the end of the article: # DeleteSnapchat.
As a Chinese American, Ms. Zhu said: "There are no people in their employees, so they can make such a decision, or some of their employees are colour, but their positions are not allowed to speak."
Other observers shared complaints that she had not been responded to by Snapchat.
The company has not published data on the diversity of staff and says it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of his employees on Thursday, but a spokesman said the company had recently hired a recruiter to pay attention to the more population and to promote internal inclusiveness.
Ms. Zhu said she would close her Snapchat account: "I want to know if they need more users like us to oppose it."
The congressional team said military officials distorted ISIS intelligence
In a report released Thursday by a congressional team, the officials of the United States Central Command changed their intelligence reports and described the war in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State.
The interim report comes from a dedicated working group organized by the House Military Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Republican Chairman of the House allocations Committee, which reports that the Central Command intelligence analysts have "widespread dissatisfaction," who say their superiors are tampering with their assessment of the war between the United States and the Islamic countries.
The Central Command (Centcom), located in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing United States military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news report on the report, "the information reviewed by the senior leaders of the Central Command has been more optimistic about United States counter-terrorism operations and has always been more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies."
The Republican representative of California said: "The conduct of the Central Command is difficult to accept. On the other hand, our fighters are suffering from war, and the other side is the wrong analysis of senior policymakers.
The leadership of the Central Command has been extended to the highest level of the institution.
The report details the long-standing problems of the Central Command in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analysing United States training in the Iraqi army.
While there is no conclusive evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration have ordered changes to the reports, according to the report, the analysts feel that they are under pressure from the leaders of the Central Command to give them more optimism about the threat of the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).
"in the first half of 2015, many central headquarters press releases, statements and congressional testimony are much more optimistic than the actual situation."
For example, a central command official has publicly indicated that a major military operation could be taken back to Mosul in April or May 2015.
Iraq's second largest city, Mosul, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
"after months of investigation, the result is clear," said Mike 蓬佩奥, a Republican representative in Kansas, in a statement.
From mid 2014 to mid 2015, most of the senior intelligence officials of the United States Central Command manipulated the intelligence products of the headquarters and concealed the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq.
The Republican Party has set up a dedicated working group after having learned from analysts about the manipulation of information about the Islamic State.
As the investigation continues, there will be more discoveries following the report released on Thursday.
The Attorney General of the Ministry of Defence also conducted a long-term investigation of the Central Command.
The Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their findings on Thursday, in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
In a statement, the Democratic Leader of the Committee said in a statement that the Central Command has developed an overly narrow process between 2014 and 2015 against the Islamic State and the Iraqi peacekeeping forces.
Mr thank said the process "hinders the release of information," reduces the morale of analysts and "cannot accept different views."
But Mr. thank and the Democrats also said they did not find any evidence to prove that the White House tried to put pressure on the central command analysts, so that their conclusions were in line with a "default or political narrative."
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday that the preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported.
Last August, the New York Times reported that after receiving a complaint from the central command analyst, the Attorney General of the Pentagon began an investigation.
A spokesman for the Pentagon spokesman, Patrick Evans, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on this congressional report before the Prosecutor General's investigation was closed.
"experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security themes," he said.
The impact of the survey has exceeded the question of whether the United States-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria have been achieved (an increasing number of defence ministry officials claim).
But last year, these claims raised the public's doubts about the extent to which President Obama could trust the military action assessments issued by the Central Command in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of the Islamic State's intelligence reminds me of the controversy over a decade ago, when central intelligence, the central headquarters intelligence analyst, wrote a study in which George W. Bush's government insisted on sending small troops to Iraq despite the opposition of many analysts and rarely took into account the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker played a key role in the opposition to the Islamic State's intelligence.
Last year, officials said Mr. Hooker's team had concluded that air strikes against the Islamic State refinery did not significantly reduce the financial income of terrorist organizations, as the terrorist organization had built a temporary oil refinery to continue to sell oil on the black market, which was quite different from those published.
According to the September report of Time Weekly, the Central Command did not publish the discovery.
When a number of lawyers examined the Senate testimony about an overly optimistic assessment of the war, the Commander of the Central Command, Lloyd Austin III, was criticized last year.
General Austen retired in April and is now replaced by Joseph Davis to replace his position in the Central Command.
The United States won four wins in women's hockey and will win a victory with the UK
Katie Bam, a three in the 6 victory over Japan, helped the American team to win a 3 victory for the American women's hockey team on Thursday.
The five goal was drama-filled, but Bam, 27, said she did not know that she had such a good performance.
"i don't know anything about it," she said.
I'm not the kind of person who will remember a few goals.
What she knows is that the United States team has won four wins in the Olympics and will compete with the team on Thursday after a 2 victory over Japan.
Britain and the United States were 狭路相逢 in the first round of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have been promoted to the quarter, and the game will determine who will appear in the first position of the team.
The team's first team will avoid a strong Dutch team, so that the Netherlands will be able to go further.
In the game on Saturday, the United States team created a miracle in an amazing way, to know that in the London Olympics four years ago, the United States team was at the bottom of the 12 teams.
Bam was also in the same team.
Growth grew up in whelped, Pennsylvania, and first picked up a hockey stick (her twin sister in 德雷克塞尔) at the age of 3 and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming the youngest member of the national team to date.
Unable to be selected for the final list, she missed the 2008 Olympics.
She and her teammates were not promising in 2012.
In the second year, British Craig 帕纳姆 was the coach, and everything began to change.
"this is a change in culture, mentality and substance," said Bam.
We had not reached the current level in London.
We came to the 彻彻 of the 彻彻.
In the first half of the week, Bam had a close backhand shot in the first half.
India has not yet tasted Law in the current game, but the team showed an amazing tenacity and kept the score of 1 to 0 to the end of the third section, when Bam broke out.
She took the ball on the left side of the court, and then went to the middle of the road and shot the net, and the United States team was in the lead.
梅利萨 Gonzalez launched the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The United States jackie for the first time in this game, and in the first three victories, the opponent scored a goal.
This time she was extraordinary.
Bam is also the case.
"we are in a good state now," 帕纳姆 said. "But how good it is depends on the results of the Saturday game.
Poor food in the Great Depression of the Great Depression
In March 1933, Franklin · Roosevelt, who had just been elected President, sat in the office of the President for lunch.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt liked the food of Fifth Avenue, such as goose and Maryland stew.
On that day, his menu was simple: ketchup devil, mashed potatoes, and fruit pudding.
"this is for the food and the people who are suffering," said Jane 齐格曼.
Her husband, Andrew ·, added: "It also reflects the American diet."
This is a food historian for couples living in the Brooklyn Highlands.
Mr. KFOR's last book, distinctive packaging, is about Chinese food in the United States, and Ms. 齐格曼 tells of the life stories of slum tenants in her "97 orchards" book.
The new book, "丰盛 meal," will be published on Tuesday by Harper Press, which describes the food history of the United States during the Great Depression.
They met a journalist in Eisemberg's sandwich shop after showing some of the common of food. The simple lunch counter in 熨斗区 has been in operation since the 1929年 economic in 1929.
Ms. 齐格曼, 54, ordered a cream olive sandwich, while Mr. KFOR, 57, ordered a turkey, mashed potato and a vegetable dish.
The reporter ordered a meatloaf, which the couple considered to be suitable for discussion of the depression during the Great Depression.
"the bread is very popular at that time," said Ms. 齐格曼.
There were peanut bread, liver bread, soy bread.
They all use a raw material and a cheap toppings that can be poured on the raw material.
Imagine your dinner is peanuts.
Mr. KFOR was a face.
"they must be like lead in your stomach," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, Americans were buffet, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women are cooking, breakfast, lunch and dinner for male farm workers.
In World War I, it was the Americans who gave food to the hungry Europeans, which recorded how the country suddenly ceased to be a place of prosperity.
Mr. KFOR explained why he and his wife had to write the book: "At that time, food had become the main topic of unhappiness for Americans."
Another unpleasant topic was the shabby new food: bread and stew, "lost food" became the main course, and the stew was "the best recipe for leftovers," said Ms. 齐格曼, because chefs can use the cream of the sauce to cover the difficult ingredients.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap fruits.
The meat that has been the leading actor on the American table for many years has become a rare luxury.
The strange hodgepodge only takes into account calories, and people are the first to think about nutrition than the taste, even the basic culinary sense.
During the study of this book, including various recipes, Ms. 齐格曼 produced a roast onion stuffed with peanut oil.
"this is not common at the dinner table," Mr. KFOR said.
"this is too strange," said Ms. 齐格曼.
Peanut oil and roast onion can't match.
This is the characteristic of many families.
Family economists influence the country's eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, the chef of the Federal Family Economics Bureau, from 1923 to 1943, which has been unique in history.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to "carefully" and to be brave enough to make bad foods such as cream Italian carrots.
"丰盛 meal" is a rich "history of history."
It is particularly interesting to note the government's response to the hungry people, such as President Herbert Hoover, "I can't handle anything else."
Although he praised the simple 爱荷华州 farmhouse in his childhood, his diet was like a millionaire.
"he likes to eat European western food, such as fish 伴," Mr. KFOR said.
He was wearing a evening dress and ate in a gold restaurant.
He was clearly separated from the people.
If her wife, Eleanor, encouraged him to set an example in his diet, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
As the book said, the housekeeper hired by Ms. Roosevelt had no interest in the taste, so "food in the White House is not only the worst food in Washington, but the worst food for cooking."
When the United States came back to the formal, many of the Great Depression cooking were abandoned.
Ms. 齐格曼 said that it was our concern about calories and nutrition and the application of science to cooking.
The couple said they were more aware of the eating habits of Ms. 齐格曼's mother when she wrote the book, such as how she did not discard the food.
"she is very afraid of wasting food," Mr. KFOR said.
"she actually caused many people to be sick," Ms. 齐格曼 recalled.
For example, there had been a "cream puffs" event.
After removing the dishes, she and Mr. KFOR took out a dessert they had prepared at home: this was the fruit pudding that President Roosevelt ate during his lunch.
"this is called the cream fruit," said Ms. 齐格曼, "and adds that a trendy name for a common dish is a" usual trick ."
There is no whipped in this dessert, only a fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctant the spoon into the thick brown paste.
Unexpectedly, the taste of the dessert is good.
Mr. KFOR ate the second spoon and the third spoon.
He thought it was an acceptable affordable dessert, and told his wife: "add a little walnut will be better."
Unfortunately, the latest OPEC report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July, with Saudi production a new record.
The report raises doubts about the credibility of OPEC, and the road to oil recovery is still 布满.
On Monday, the President of OPEC and the Qatar Energy Minister, Posada Posada, said that OPEC would hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on 26 - 28 September.
Production, including Gabon, has risen 4.6 million barrels per day in July, to 3311 million barrels per day, according to a monthly report released by OPEC on Wednesday.
Low also said in a monthly report that the low price of crude oil has prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil, thereby exacerbating the market oversupply.
As a result of this news, combined with the US increase in crude oil production expectations and an unexpected increase in crude oil stocks, international oil prices have been fell for two consecutive days.
As of Wednesday, the price of light oil futures delivered in September by the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 2.48%, and in October, the price of Brent crude in London fell 2.07%.
According to Reuters, the proposed oil producer meeting is unlikely to make the supply tight, and the data released by the US Energy Department also down market sentiment.
Iran's official news agency, Fars Fars, quoted Iranian oil minister 赞加内 on Wednesday that Iran's crude oil production was up to 385 million barrels, the highest level since 2008.
The news of the meeting just came out, the Russian energy minister, Manfred Nowak, said there was no need for a new round of 冻产 negotiations under current oil prices.
The last meeting of the oil-producing countries was already in April, and OPEC members were unable to agree on any measures.
Market oil, an oil and gas analyst at BMIResearch, said the market and the media could be excessive about the meeting that OPEC will hold.
Croft Croft, head of commodity strategy for the Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC could change the mood of the market by releasing signals that they would lead to the agreement.
This tool is like a smoke of smoke and a mirror (deliberately misleading).
Weinberg Weinberg, director of commodity research at the German Commercial Bank, said it was believed that OPEC was trying to stabilize the market through the September meeting.
This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC. After all, the organization has staged a "wolf."

However, in the case of most of the Internet health companies struggling to finance the A or B, there are several down leading companies that still get capital popular.
It seems that the Internet medical business is not "a nest of bees," but to see market demand, sink to be dedicated and deep.
Dive contributed $1200.00 million, accounting for 40% of registered capital and $1800.00 million, or 60% of registered capital.
In recent years, with the country's policy support in medical informatization, the electronic and integrated supply chain management system gradually enters all levels of hospital.
The cooperation between dive and 九州通 is aimed at the demand of the market, helping the hospital to set up the advanced supply chain management system, and as an opportunity to seek more cooperation.

Ali is now divided into three sections in the health care area, namely, Ali's health, Tmall medicine and Alipay future hospital.
Wang Lei admits that health care is more difficult than other industries. "It's not just a lot of money, also, resistance, slowly."

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union had brought missiles into Cuba, almost leading to a nuclear war in the United States of America.
The incident was seen as the culmination of the cold war, known as the "Cuban missile crisis."
But what is not known is that, during the Cold War, a strong solar storm had barely led to a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was first published by researchers until 9 August.
On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm caused strong interference with the United States military radar and radio communications in the Arctic.
These radars are part of the United States ballistic missile early warning system for the monitoring of Soviet missiles.
The paper, which was completed by researchers at the University of Colorado, interviewed United States military personnel who were involved in forecasting and analysing solar activities, and consulted the literature.
The paper wrote that, in the 1960s, in order to prevent a sudden nuclear war in the Soviet Union, the United States Air Force had always had a portion of the aircraft carrying nuclear warheads flying in the sky.
The U. S. military commander did not know that the main culprit was the solar storm, not the Soviet Union, and ordered the aircraft to enter the battle readiness.
Fortunately, the solar activity of the United States military, which began in the late 1950s, and its research on Earth's electromagnetic interference, ultimately prevented the potential military conflict.
Later, he summarized the information provided by the Air Force of the United States Air Force and submitted a detailed report.
The direct consequence of this solar storm is that the United States military has since seen space weather as a combat concern and has established a stronger space weather forecasting system.

In the referendum Day, the South sports and cultural park outside the city of Hangzhou opened the veil of mystery.
This was coal, which was closed more than a decade ago, leaving a large number of illegal buildings and living waste.

The Jewish movie criticized the Berlin Hotel to delete the Israeli telephone code according to the Arab customer's "requirements"
A French film producer of Jewish origin revealed to the media that the Kempinski Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's telephone code and that the hotel staff said it was the "requirement" of the Arab client.
Claude 朗兹曼, author of the Holocaust documentary , expressed his disappointment at the Kempinski Hotel and published an open letter in the German Report.
During the recent stay, 朗兹曼 wanted to find Israel on the phone code list provided by the hotel.
But Israel has not been among the countries where the guests can speak directly from the room.
Did Israel disappear in the German capital, Berlin, in 2016?
朗兹曼 wrote.
Instead, guests can call Israel through the call center of the Kempinski Hotel.
To seek explanation, the film producer asked the front desk of the hotel.
In the letter, 朗兹曼 said he was shocked by the answer he had received at the front desk.
Hotel personnel say this is "the decision made by the management of the Kempinski Hotel."
The reason for doing so is to make the film producer angry.
朗兹曼 quoted the employee's words: Most of our guests were Arabs, and they called for the removal of Israeli code.
According to the Nande Daily News, the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov 哈达斯, called this "humiliation."
We were surprised to learn about the incident.
This is a great shame in itself.
In Germany and the chain of hotels, it was a disgrace.
There is no need to explain the matter.
"we want the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident sparked a heated debate on the Internet, and it was considered a scandal.
Some people think that the Kempinski hotel is "卑躬" in order to meet the demands of the Arab customers.
Another post pointed to the "really" of the hotel and pointed out that the main street in the famous 库达姆 Street was near a Jewish synagogue.
According to mirror, the hotel quickly clarified all the charges, claiming that everything was "negligent" and apologized to 朗兹曼.
The Nande Daily quoted Kempinski's representative: "There has never been a direct order to remove Israel from the fast dial list."
The paper also said that the Israeli code had been added to the list.

Scotland own 卡尔姆 won the gold medal after winning the gold medal
Scotland 卡尔姆卡尔姆 Skinner success last
The 23 Glasgow, the 23-year-old cyclist, replaced his Scotland, Sir Chris Hoy, and became the backbone of the team, who was proud of the legendary own when young Skinner defeated the win Zealand and 载誉.
Four years ago, the British team was a blockbuster, and Hoy won the fifth of the six Olympic gold medals.
The British team ranked sixth at the World bicycle Championships in London in March, and Hoy had since retired.
During the Beijing Olympics to the London Olympics, the British team's problem was to change the "first circle of experts" Jamie Nowy.
The convoy did so when 辛德斯 appeared.
Hoy's retirement also left a gap, and money.K · and Matt 克兰普顿 wanted to fill the gap.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the British men's team staff insisted that he be selected for the national team, and Skinner ended up with his expectations.
Skinner's partner is 辛德斯 and Kenny, who won the gold medal four years ago with Hoy, who refresh the Olympic record in the qualifying period.
The three British Tour eventually beat their opponents and won the gold medal.
Although 辛德斯 is a little behind, Kenny has been leading the team, and Mr. Skinner keeps the leading advantage to the end.
The transformation of the strategy is the key to this reversal, and 辛德斯 chooses the larger flywheel, so the speed is slower, and this allows Kenny, especially Skinner, to keep pace.
Hoy watched the game as a BBC commentator. Skinner, Kenny and 辛德斯 saw him when he was on the podium.
This Skinner, 23, said: "This makes me feel flattered."
I'm just doing everything I can to make myself escape.
We created the Olympic record in the final and beat the world champion.
It's incredible.
Nothing is better than this victory.
After winning the gold medal with Kenny and Hoy at the London Games in 2012, 辛德斯 admitted that he was deliberately down on the track in a bad start.
Later, he withdrew the comments, and the British team's opponents were unable to appeal.
There is no such problem for this victory.
"it's like a British flag on the platform," 辛德斯 said.
We just got a team three months ago.
We have lost many world champions, so it's amazing to be able to defend the Olympic champions.
This is just a game and a gold medal for a British team in the Beijing Olympic Games and the London Olympic Games.
If this symbolizes the progress we have made in the past five months, we will continue to succeed in the bicycle hall in the next five days.
According to Kenny, he has not been able to recreate the feat of winning three gold medals at the Olympic Games.
If that was the case, Kenny would have six gold medals and a silver medal, as he was 12 years old and also on March 23, which appeared to be a sacred day of British sport, Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger beat were born on the day.
This achievement is at the same level as Hoy.
Kenny is going to fight for a three-day race today.
"i will focus on the game for a while," said the 28 的.
The team game is always the best.
You can win the game with your teammates.
To be frank, a man's victory is a little lonely.
"if he can win the other two gold medals, he should be awarded a jazz title," 辛德斯 said.
This was the only game that had produced a medal on the day, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed ·, Steven Burke and Owen Touré have made the fastest progress to the four people group chase.
Their grades are 351.943.
In 2012, the world record of gold medals in the London Olympic Games was 351.659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will be held on the second day of today, and Wiggins will undoubtedly be the focus of the spotlight.
He had a dispute with the competition officer yesterday, when the competition officer told him to measure his height.
In the women game, which will end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna 罗瑟尔, Eleanor Buck and Kate Archibald, from 米尔盖, are promoted in the new world record.
The British team relies on a powerful sites team to take the initiative in the middle of the Olympics and 囊获 more medals.
After showing its absolute dominance at the Beijing and London games, the British bicycle team was a little disappointed in the process of going to Rio.
Many twists and turns occurred during the period, including the resignation of the April Technical Director, Sean Sutton, on the basis of gender discrimination and bullying, as well as the retirement of legendary figures such as Hoy and Victoria ·.
But the first game night in the bicycle hall is a testament to the legend that the British team will be at the peak of the critical moment.

The head of the Division of Industrial Coordination of the National Development and Reform Commission noted today that overcapacity is a global problem.
In our country, the utilization rate of annual output is higher than the global average, but also higher than the countries and regions of the United States and Europe.
Our country has taken firm and effective measures to resolve excess capacity, and its effectiveness is gradually becoming apparent.
The director noted that the State Council of the Central Committee attached great importance to the global problem of overcapacity.
All departments and regions are actively implementing the State Council's deployment and work carefully, and this year will reduce the steel capacity of about 45 million tons.
From our national circumstances, we do not encourage the export of steel, but also take a series of practical measures to control the export of steel.
The director stressed that the international trade in steel products is essentially the market behavior, which is derived from the demand of the importing country, the consumer's comprehensive consideration of product price and so on.
The implementation of trade protection measures does not contribute to a fundamental solution to the development of the global steel industry, but rather a further impact on the international trade order.
In terms of debt, the head emphasized that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly addressed in the process of addressing excess capacity.
Because of the large size and scope of the assets of steel enterprises, some enterprises have a complex debt relationship and, if disposed of, may trigger a regional risk.
According to the director, in recent years, as the economic downward pressure has increased, the total demand of society has gradually diminished, and some industries have decreased capacity utilization, and the enterprise production and business difficulties increase.
Some enterprises do not adapt to the change in the market environment, production operations are unsustainable and even close to bankruptcy, but are constrained by a number of institutional mechanisms, and the barriers to exit in a market-oriented manner have become "zombie enterprises."
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces the efficiency of the utilization of factor resources, increases the cost of social management and hinders the establishment of a fair competition market environment.
The main cause of the loss is the same as the global steel industry, the market demand is weak and capacity utilization is low.
Our country mainly adopts the market mechanism, economic means and the rule of law, and the government is mainly to work well for staff and social stability to ensure a fair and fair market order.
The leader stressed that the next step is to continue to work on the 去产能 work and to ensure that five years of the goal of resolve 1 million tons of steel capacity will be completed.

The future of the Portland smelter is fraught with uncertainty because of the cancellation of the power supply contract
Hundreds of workers in Victoria, in Victoria, and hundreds of workers in the factory, are now facing an uncertain future, as the power company, which is powered by the factory, revealed that a factory owner would terminate a supply contract, thereby failure all supply contracts.
This initiative took place after the Government's decision not to continue to grant subsidies to ensure the operation of the factory.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years will be terminated in November.
2000 workers in the Portland factory in Alcoa may face unemployment.
Once the factory is closed, up to 2,000 people may be unemployed directly or indirectly.
And because the plant's electricity consumption accounts for about 10% of Victoria's total power output, it may also have a ripple effect.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the 汉瑞角 smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesey power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is currently losing and facing the risk of closure.
The move was made after a forecast of the factory in the next few years, initially because of the strength of the Australian dollar, and recently because of the price of factory products.
AGL provides electricity to the large aluminum smelter through the 老埃杨 power plant, which predicts that three other factory owners will also terminate their agreements.
The biggest shareholder of the factory is a joint venture between a Alcoa company and an alumina company, while China's Citic Group and Japan's Marubeni Co. Ltd also hold a small share of shares.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, which means that the smelter will continue to produce electricity," the joint venture said.
AGL said the contracts were "hedging contracts" that should have been in force since November 2016.
The contract is for a period of 12 months, so they will be terminated in 2017.
"therefore, AGL continues to predict that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in the fiscal year 2017."
Any income impact that may have been made to AGL since the 2018 fiscal year is now subject to an optimistic outlook for the wholesale price of the futures market.
AGL said the company had written down $187 million in contract value in the "termination expectations."
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate these contracts "would not affect the ability of Alcoa to operate the smelter or to guarantee the power supply to the smelter."
The United States company indicated that it had signed a 20-year contract with 老埃杨 in 2010, which would have entered into force in November this year, but the company did not explain why it had withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland smelter in Victoria and the 托马戈 plant near Newcastle will be closed because of the bad economic situation in the industry.
In response to the comments made by analysts earlier this week, Stephen Michelsen, chief manager of AGL, said the annual volume of electricity was about 600 MW per year, and the 托马戈 factory reached about 900 MW.
If the two factories are closed, the demand for the power market will be significantly reduced.
"it's not good news for us," he said.
The community law centre excludes 160,000 people each year
Each year, more than 160,000 the most vulnerable groups are excluded from the community law centre. This service is already overstretched and is now facing further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three out of five people were denied access to free legal advice and proxy services, most of them elderly, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and persons without resources to combat unfair evictions.
The lack of funding for community legal services has long exceeded the limits and is now facing further funding cuts.
The Federal Government's funding for these legal centres will be reduced by 30% since June next year.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Law Center, said thousands of people were excluded every year, according to the latest national community association law centre.
Mr. Farrell said that if the federal government did not change the existing decision, the situation would only become worse.
"the Queensland community law centre is chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people will not have access to the important services they need," he said.
Those who need to stay away from violence, those who are burdened with large debts that cannot be repaid, families facing segregation and battered workers are faced with legal aspects, and the report shows that they are not able to obtain the help they need.
The federal government will cut a further 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable groups in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Queensland Member of Queensland, George Brandeis, to immediately withdraw the decision to reduce the funds, so that people can get the help they need in the face of legal issues.
Last year, the state government was committed to raising legal aid funds to the national average.
It is now important to focus on the needs of community legal centres and their counterparts, and the white government must also be involved in this important work.

The Olympic Games benefited greatly from the Stratford and Eastern regions.
And we will create opportunities for the local people and businesses near Heathrow to benefit the region again.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprentices, 40,000 new jobs and lift young people around the airport out of their jobs.
Just before the 2012 London Olympics, some people thought that the expansion of Heathrow was too large.
I was told that Britain would not be able to prepare for the Olympics, and we would be humiliated in the face of the world.
Skeptics are wrong with the 2012 Olympics, and their doubts about the Heathrow project will prove to be wrong.
While there are always obstacles that need to be overcome, Heathrow is addressing each of the problems it faces.
As in the Olympic Games, Heathrow is a infrastructure project for most people, not a few.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs, bringing an economic growth of 2110 billion, leaving a wealth of technology and employment around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team, which has completed a 110 infrastructure investment project on time and within the budget, including the T5 terminal of the world's best airport terminal for five consecutive years and the T2 terminal between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now they are ready to build a third runway with a private investment of 160 billion.
Britain has successfully hosted the 2012 London Olympics, and I believe that the Heathrow airport expansion project will be a great success.
It is a good time to deliver the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, so that we can escort our future and create a wealth of technology and employment that is proud of the United Kingdom.
Lord Paul Dayton is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Heathrow Airport and the former Business Counsellor of the Ministry of Finance of the United Kingdom
A woman committed suicide and was run over on the Swiss highway
The victim lay on the highway at midnight.
The 试图 woman was run over by a number of cars on the highway on Thursday morning. The police are looking for witnesses.
The accident happened on Thursday morning on the A1 highway near Morges, Vaud.
The police said a woman was lying on the highway at night and was run over by a number of cars.
The victim was a 49 Swiss woman with a clear suicide intention. She was run over by a number of cars, including a truck.
The woman died on the spot.
Police revealed that many of the affected drivers had been investigated, but some of the drivers were still not confirmed. The police are now calling for them and the accident witnesses to come to the investigation.
Lawyers Hoff, lawyers 施泰特尔, told the Geneva Tribune that criminal investigations have been initiated, which is the regular process of such incidents.
However, it is not known whether a driver will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
"this will be determined by the prosecutor," Hoff said.
Based on the results of two other similar cases in the past five years, drivers will not be held accountable.
The two cases, according to the report, were caused by the fact that people were on the highway late in the night. The final verdict was that the driver could not expect pedestrians to cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was charged with an inadvertent death, with the allegation that in August 2014, she struck a man and died on the A1 highway near 帕耶讷.
The court was informed that the 22-year-old victim crossed the road after drinking.
After the investigation, the judge said the police officer was in full legality, and the man appeared on the road, "entirely unexpected and unpredictable," and the police officer then dialed the first aid phone.
Any person who can provide information about the accident near Morges on Thursday should call 0216448346 or 0216444444 to contact the police.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was suitable for human habitation
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was suitable for human habitation.
Scientists from NASA's Goddard Space Institute developed a model to explore the past situation of Venus, which uses the tools and algorithms that are very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether Venus, where the surface is high, without water, and the atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, has an environment similar to the Earth.
Previously, the scientists believed that Venus's rotation rate was slower because of its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation shows that Venus might have had a thinner atmosphere similar to the Earth's atmosphere, and the rate of rotation was just as slow.
The model also shows the early terrain of Venus.
The dry areas of Venus may be more than the Earth, but there are enough water and geographic changes to breed life and prevent rapid evaporation.
In the early days, the brightness of sunlight on Venus was 30% darker than the Earth.
"the slow rotation of Venus in the model simulation of the Goddard Space Research Institute (space), the slow rotation of Venus 使 the day of the day for nearly two months," Anthony scientists, a scientist at the Goddard Space Institute, explained at a press conference.
This makes the surface warm and produces rainwater that can form a 厚云层, which is like an umbrella to block most of the sun's heat.
The result of the simulation is that the average climate temperature of Venus is actually a few degrees lower than the Earth now.
The evolution of Venus in the model is similar to that of previous planetary scientists.
Although Venus may have lived on Venus, Venus has been exposed to high temperatures and ultraviolet rays for billions of years.
The sea evaporation on the planet, and water vapour is also burned by ultraviolet rays.
With the escape of hydrogen, there is only a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse gas effect, thus forming the Venus we know today.
The researchers published the simulation results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research.
Patrick Roy resigned as manager of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as manager and vice president of the Colorado avalanche hockey, who said he had no say at the team's decision-making level.
Joe 萨奇斯, managing vice president of Colorado, confirmed the news and said the club would start looking for a new coach.
"over the past three years, I have carried out the responsibilities of the Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president with vigour, passion and determination."
I thought about how to improve the team throughout the summer.
To that end, the manager and vice president's goals must be in line with the club's goals.
He also has to have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
At present, however, these conditions have not yet been met.
萨奇斯 hired Roy on 23 May 2013, and he thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"patrick told me his decision today," 萨奇斯 said.
We thank him for his contribution to the club and hope that he will succeed in the future.
Roy was nominated as the best coach of the Jack 亚当斯奖 Alliance during the first season of pre-service in 2013 - 14.
He helped the club get 112 points in the central division, but Rainey was phase-out in the first round of the playoffs and missed the playoffs in the last two years.
In the 2015 - 16 season, Avalanche's performance was 39 and 39 Ping, and eventually lost the second card of the Western League Division at five points.
As the Hall of the Hall of Hall,, won the 四座斯坦利杯, each with two seats for Montreal and Avalanche.
The North Sea oil field workers stopped strike and continued negotiations
The chief negotiator said workers in the North Sea oil field stopped the strike on pay, and the parties to the dispute began a new round of negotiations.
Royal Dutch Shell runs the North Sea oil platform on a number of occasions on a strike against the oil field service company Wood Group.
According to a joint statement, "Wood Group and Unite 和 and RMT trade can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of resolving the current dispute."
We will start a more meeting in the coming weeks, starting earlier next week, to revisit these issues.
The trade union said its recent action was to protest the highest possible 30% pay reduction, which was the first time that trade unions had taken this action in 25 years.
Wood Group has reduced the compensation of the North Sea contractor by about 9% this year because of market pressure.
Before the pay cuts, the company reduced the compensation of the maritime contractor by 10% in 2014.
The company said the second pay cut would help the company through the depression of the market.
Shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down its oil and gas equipment in 10 countries, because the company needs to streamline its operations after the merger with the British Energy Corporation, the British Gas Group.
Energy companies are facing pressure from the decline in crude oil prices and the Brexit decision in June.
Dave Anderson, a member of the Scottish Parliament, met with trade union leaders earlier this week to explore the biggest labour dispute in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea was crucial to the regional economy.
"in the North Sea and the country as a whole, we need an economy that serves most people rather than a few."
In 2016, expenditures for new North Sea projects are expected to be less than $1.4 billion, compared to the average project expenditure of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measured the rotation speed of the stars of the Pleiades cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers collect the most complete rotation of the 昂宿星团 star.
New data are helping astronomers understand why the stars of the cluster have different rotation speed and the relationship between the rotation cycle and the composition of the planet.
"we want to further understand the relationship between star quality, age, and even the history of the solar system," 卢萨, a research scientist at the infrared Institute of Technology, said at a press conference.
The Pleiades cluster is 445 light from the Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and have just reached adulthood.
They have reached the highest rate of rotation in their lifetime.
At the highest rate of rotation, these mature stars emit a large number of stellar.
When they pass through the magnetic field of the star, they have a brake effect on the stars.
As the age of the star increases, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measured the rotation speed of the stars by tracking the time of a recognizable stars (like sun).
The latest rotation data set shows that the larger stars rotate faster than smaller stars.
Raible will the star, and the larger dancers rotate faster than smaller dancers.
"in the " of the Pleiades clusters, we find that the more stars tend to be more quality, and the fastest stars are often the lightest stars," Raible said.
Due to the proximity of the Pleiades cluster, it can be used as an ideal space laboratory for comparing star quality and rotation speed.
"the Pleiades cluster provides the basis for a two-way rotation theory model of young and old stars," Raible said.
We still have a lot of knowledge about how, when and why the stars slow down and "up their shoes."
Raible and her colleagues elaborated on their latest analysis of the rotation speed of the Pleiades cluster in three new papers. These three papers will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
The South Lake Park Water Management Section, Zheng army, said the South Lake bottom is more than 10 metres above the bottom of the water, and it is likely to be dangerous.
"although the South Lake rescue team is very professional, it is hoped that a wide range of boating visitors can wear a life jacket, do not do illegal actions on the lake and play safely," Zheng said.
Weitou village has the unique marine environment, sits on the natural ecology and human ecology two major leisure tourism resources.
"but the individual owners who have bought a residential parking space, fearing that this will affect the rental price of their parking spaces, and doubt that others are selfish, so they have been 搞, causing the parking of parking spaces to be put on hold."
In the academic world, there is still a wide variety of opinions about the question of when sweet is introduced.
In the current more mainstream point of view, there are three main lines in the introduction of sweet.
The most influential and spread of the three lines introduced by sweet is that Chen 振龙 was introduced to Fuzhou by the Philippines.
The Beijing Social Group Management Office will carry out a special inspection of the use of harmonization receipts for social groups.
The inspection is divided into two kinds of unit self-examination and focus.
The scope of this inspection includes social groups in the municipal community in the period from 2013 to 2015 with a unified receipt of contributions from social groups.
"the success of the Olympics is defined by people who share stories in social media."
According to the report of the Olympic Games, the media have changed much more than ever in the way of transmission, product form, language style, news perspective, etc.
The International Olympic Committee and media practitioners from all over the world seem to have met this round of challenges.
On August 11, Everbright Securities H shares were publicly available for sale on the last day. It was said that the market was flat two days before the IPO, which was scheduled to be listed on August 18 in HKEx.
An analyst at the country said that the East Securities was not a good basis in Hong Kong.
Experts say that since this year, as the securities market has returned to a flat, many brokerage firms have experienced a decline in performance, but it is not possible to generalize about the development of the company's own business after listing.
After the introduction of the new deal, Suzhou will be the first secondary city in the country to buy heavy.
The second - line cities that are in place or are about to introduce the housing market are more than Suzhou, including Hefei, Nanjing and other cities.
Previously, Hefei had taken the lead in issuing a limits policy, and banks would refuse to provide mortgage services for home buyers with two sets of housing loans in Hefei.
