28-year-old chef was found dead in a San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a stairway at a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to harm him and said "everything is finally getting better."
The San Francisco coroner's office said the body found at the West Tin shopping centre Wednesday morning was confirmed as Frank Galicia, a 28-year-old San Francisco resident.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death case was ruled as homicide and was under investigation.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's San Francisco radio station KGO that Frank, who previously worked as a pipeline cook in Boston, found an ideal job for a pipeline chef six months ago at the Songs & Daughers restaurant in San Francisco.
A spokesman for the Songs & Daughters restaurant said they were "very shocked" by Frank's death.
"We are a small team of people who get along like a close family and we will miss him deeply," the spokesman said.
At this sad moment, we express our deep sympathy and condolences to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially lived in the guest house, but recently "everything is finally getting better."
Louis Galicia told KGO: 'Frank found an apartment while at the same time interacting with a girl.'
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to harm his brother.
Frank has a good heart and wide bosom.
"Frank often cooks dinner for his family," Louis Galicia said.
He was never willing to quarrel with his family.
He was a man who followed everyone's opinions.
Louis Galicia said: "All things in the world are likely to go wrong, but Frank is called an outlandish man who shines every day."
Please call the San Francisco Police Department to report 415-575-4444.
Junior doctor strikes: Call for new labor action
Junior doctor representatives called on the coalition to approve its new labor action against the new contract dispute.
The British Medical Association's junior doctors committee will ask all its members to support more labor action since early September.
The junior doctors' committee said ministers did not address concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to boycott a contract deal with the British Medical Association.
Of the members involved in the vote, 58% opposed the contract deal.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the junior doctors committee, said in a letter to members posted on Twitter late Thursday night that the government had "always been silent" about the issue that led to a boycott of the contract.
"In view of this, the Executive Committee of the junior doctor's committee has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and calls for a renewed formal consultation on all concerns," she said.
In response to the Government's reticence, the Executive Committee of the junior doctors' committee has today formally asked the Council of the British Medical Association to hold a special meeting to approve a long-term plan to upgrade labour operations starting in early September.
The dispute has led junior doctors to participate in six strikes this year, including the first full strike in the history of the NHS in the UK.
Dr Johann Malawana, leader of junior doctors at the British Medical Association, resigned after a boycott of the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the British Medical Association.
In a meeting before the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students, he told members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be enforced among England's healthcare staff.
Russia and Turkey: "Out of the league"?
A gesture ends a crisis.
Russia and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday and the two sides shook hands and announced a formal end to eight months of verbal and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish president in the golden hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I had a strong feeling that the reconciliation was what Ankara would most like to see.
Yes, the two sides did shake hands.
However, even in the light of Mr Putin's inward-looking criteria, Putin is only a shallow smile, with little enthusiasm.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan reportedly mentioned "good friend" Putin five times.
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia would return to pre-crisis levels, even to a higher level.
The next day, a newspaper wrote that Mr Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
But, I think his enthusiasm suggests something to the contrary.
Mr Putin's continued indifference, however, shows that he has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter at the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction was intense at the time.
Mr Putin lashed out at the incident, accusing Ankara of counting Moscow behind its back.
Attacks from so-called friends are more unacceptable.
It is hard for both sides and it's not even possible to re-establish real trust.
Russian polls have also turned around since November.
For months, the government-controlled media carried out a shocking and full attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
Among them, the most serious are accusations from senior officials: Mr Erdogan's family profit from illegal oil deals in the so-called Islamic State-controlled Syrian region.
He has flatly denied the claim.
However, news from St. Petersburg showed that it was time to look forward.
After all, the meeting was premised on Putin receiving an apology from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Russia could announce victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the truce are obvious.
First, Erdogan was nearly ousted after a failed coup last month, so he needed the support of all his friends.
The ongoing terror attacks have clearly hit him hard.
There are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, particularly by banning charter services that could send millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The figure has fallen nearly 90 percent.
As flights resume, Russian travel agents and charter companies will be relieved.
They will usher in the tide of Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
State television even predicted this week that the price of fruit and vegetables would fall once Turkey's agricultural imports were re-opened.
"The tourists went and the tomatoes came back," a report by Moscow newspaper Vedemosti said.
For Moscow, the visit also has extra political value.
Ankara is angry about the Western world's weak response to takeover intentions.
In addition, Ankara has long been unhappy with the slow progress in EU negotiations and Putin's involvement, and Putin is keen to take advantage of political chill and weaken Turkey's ties with the Western world.
As a result of the defeat of the elected authorities after the failed coup, the Russian leader is bound to gain Ankara's bonus points.
Note that this is a gift for Moscow, which has always had a deep fear of regime change.
So the meeting in this golden seaside palace has led Russia to ally with Turkey, two countries that have been rejected and abused by the Western world, an analyst described as an "alien alliance."
However, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two sides.
Syria is one of the key factors, and Moscow has played a role in Syria recently, while Russia and Turkey have backed the opposite faction.
Predictably, after nearly three hours of preliminary talk, the two presidents said at the conference that the topic had not been talked about.
The Turkish president deliberately shunned questions about the differences between the two sides, while Putin stressed it.
The two sides have not reached a clear consensus on how to pursue differences on Syria.
The resumption of dialogue between the leaders of the two countries is certainly a good thing, given the months of public hostility and the potential for large-scale disaster caused by the shooting down of Russian warplanes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states.
RBS will no longer serve customers outside Scotland
Banks will be simplified into a logistics department, according to RBS's chief executive.
RBS will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland division that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand was once committed to its global ambitions.
But eight years ago it was on the verge of collapse and it had to be accepted that the pursuit had been abandoned since then.
During that time, brand strategists used "RBS" to protect other consumer finance brands.
The group has spent millions of pounds to sponsor international sporting events, such as the Rugby Six Nations and Wimbledon tennis tournament champion Andy Murray.
But now, the right thing is to make more national brands emerge.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but will not return to the original.
In England and Wales, all references outside the headquarters and stock exchanges will be changed to the National Westminster Bank.
The Alster Bank brand has been used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Autonomous Region.
There are other, more prominent, smaller private banking brands, such as Treasury Bank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McYoon was interviewed during a tour of Inverness County customers and staff.
"The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our brand of investors, as well as one of the employees' employment brands, because at the moment we have become a bank with a large number of brands," he told the BBC Scotland division.
Since the bank itself became an international brand, RBS also became a global brand.
At the moment, I would like to say that we are no longer focused on the world and we have turned our eyes to home.
Each brand represents the difference between their respective industries, and our employees serve customers through different brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland has shown it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Championship; at the same time, efforts have been made to raise the profile of different brands in sporting events.
"It's time to become a multi-brand bank, because privately we've been looking at how to be a better bank to serve customers," the chief executive said.
If we aspire to become a big bank with a lot of brands three years ago, it will be ridiculed.
At present we focus on customer needs, and I am sure you have noticed these changes.
I think we can restart these brands and now the time is right.
Mr Daley has earned 3,000 wins from his success at Newcastle
Newcastle's two wins helped Dartley achieve a career 3,000 wins, after which he sprayed champagne to celebrate
On Friday, Frankie Dettori, a jockey, scored his 33,000 victory at Newmarket.
He made a career of 3,000 wins by winning two victories on the horse's path by Preilsection, the hand of John Gosden, a trainer.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional jockey to have achieved this milestone in the field of the flat race.
The top five were Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddy, and Willie Carson, respectively.
The three-time champion jockey, who won earlier in Ghayyar, said: 'It's special.'
I was excited because my family was also on the scene
I'm pleased with what I've achieved in Newcastle, because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a large-scale Jockey Club or Royal Ascot, which is just a regular Friday night with 20,000 viewers.
I'm very happy and humble.
Dartley, who led the Preadout after the win, caused the whole crowd to cheer
In the arena of hurdles, two jockeys have achieved this achievement, with Sir Richard Johnson, the champion jockey, and Sir Anthony McCoy, who is now retired, in which Sir McCoy scored more than 4,300 victories in his record-breaking career.
Berger, who was the nine-year-old champion, scored 4,493 victories in his career
Dartley is one of the best jockeys of the day, so it's not surprising that he has achieved this landmark achievement, and there are not many people who have achieved that achievement before him.
He was stylish and robust, but what really made him stand out in the weighing room was his tactical rationality.
He was an amazing equestrian ambassador, and for years his enthusiasm and charm attracted a lot of fans for the campaign.
A few weeks ago, I told Dave in Epsom that if he wasn't just a weekend with the game jockey, he should have been able to get 6,000 wins!
Seriously, it's too important for Daley to be the best equestrian winner in the UK for 30 years.
He has a lively personality, which is good for the British horse race, but beyond that, he is an incredible jockey.
Dartley celebrated the milestone with his iconic jump-horse movement
From the jump line to the jump down the horse, for twenty years, Dartley has been a typical representative of the field in the UK.
His career is like a roller coaster.
He won a number of competition titles, including a famous "seven-streak win" in 1996 at the Royal Ecclesiko Jockey Club, but he also suffered a crash and was banned for taking banned drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned to the field after the end of the six-month ban, he had a hard time, but he showed an amazing personality and finally got back to the top, giving those who were skeptical.
He might not have been able to do it for a long time-Dartley had previously said he hoped to compete at least until the age of 50.
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed Sergei Ivanov's chief of staff
Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, unexpectedly lifted Sergei Ivanov's head of the president's office.
For years, Mr Ivanov has been part of a core group deeply trusted by Mr Putin.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed Special Representative on Environment and Transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said Mr Putin had "announced the removal of Ivanov's head of the Russian president's office," but did not give reasons.
Anton Vaino, who started as deputy to Mr Ivanov in 2012, has been appointed his successor.
Mr Waino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, the Estonian capital, in 1972, he graduated from the famous Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
He later managed the presidential draft and government staff, the Kremlin website (in Russian) said.
After being appointed, he said to Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of this government is to support the head of state in drafting laws and control directives.
Mr Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr Ivanov himself had asked to resign and recommended Mr Vaino to take over himself.
Is such a smile compelling?
Moscow was puzzled by the move.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Putin's closest aides and, like Putin, has worked at the Soviet Security Agency (KGB).
As chief of staff, he was once one of the most influential people in the country.
At a meeting with President Vladimir Putin on state television, both said it was the chief of staff's own request to resign.
Despite the smile in front of the camera, almost no one was convinced-especially at this time before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of a defeat in some kind of power race?
It is not yet known.
But the official claim that a candidate who had been seen as a presidential candidate suddenly chose to take control of Russia's environmental policies-drew a lot of suspicion.
On the Kremlin's website, quoting Mr Ivanov's dialogue with Mr Putin, he said: "Yes, at the beginning of 2012, I asked you in a dialogue to give me this difficult position, or even a troubled position, for a four-year term."
"As a result, I've been president of the Office of the President for four years and eight months."
Mr Ivanov held the post in December 2011.
Before that, he served as deputy prime minister and defense secretary.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Mr Putin, is a former member of the National Security Agency.
In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin became chief of the Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly the National Security Agency), Mr Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
After Mr Putin came to power, he appointed Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov could be the Russian president after Mr Putin's second term, as the third term was unconstitutional.
But the post eventually belonged to Dmitry Medvedev, another close aide to Putin.
Before re-serving as president three and a half years later, Mr Putin served as Russia's prime minister.
The mysterious fish startled the Banff Garden
A resident of Banff found a fish to surprise his garden and then sent for help.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish may have been blown by sea tornadoes.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a video of the strange scene on Perisciope, hoping someone could explain to him why these two inches of fish would appear.
The Kunsfili Bridge is now available to Faff
The $1.35 billion project is planned for completion in May 2017
Engineers have connected the North Bridge and the Viaduct of Queens Bridge, which means that the bridge is now available to Faff.
Four "bridge deck fans" near the three bridgeheads of each bridge are now close to completion, and the project is the first of its kind.
The bridge, which started in Faff, is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 metric tons.
It used 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 oblique cables.
The $1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the scene today and became one of the first people to board the bridge.
"This is a historic moment in the construction of the Quincy Bridge," he said.
We all witnessed engineering work on such an ambitious project, and more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel were used in this section of the building alone.
Although the size and weight of the bridge is huge, the completion of the bridge between the bridge and the bridge requires fine work, which requires very precise assembly.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total deck has now been installed, and the concrete deck of the last section of the bridge is poured in Royth today, meaning that all the deck is ready.
"No matter which bridge project, the first time the Dragon is a major milestone," said Michael Martin, director of the project director of the Quincy Bridge Construction Company.
As far as the remarkable project is concerned, the dragon shows the front-line civil engineering technology.
After installing the last section of the pavement and connecting it to the expanded North Bridge road board, it will be necessary to complete the north side or close to the land side of the remaining gap.
Completion of the operation requires the removal of 700 millimetres south of the northern elevated bridge.
It's a massive operation, and it's also a very sophisticated operation.
It says it's huge because the viaduct is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 metric tons and needs to pull out a slope of about 3%.
It's precise because the engineering team needs to make sure the deviation is very small, with only a few millimetres per side.
Thankfully, everything is going well.
Simon Biles picked up the women's gymnastics all-round champion
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is not affected by all this.
The horse is full of vitality.
The balance beam has a lot to do with it.
The movement of the free gymnastics is stunning.
The overall performance was excellent.
Now, it has finally become the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast picked up the All-Around title on Thursday and fully displayed her talent for leading the world in gymnastics at the Olympic Games.
She took the total score of 62.198 with the silver medal winner, Ally Raisman, the final five-member team, and Aliya Mustafina, a bronze medalist in Russia.
Simon Byers, from the United States, carried out the balance-beam performance at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday at the Artistic Gymnastics Women's Individual All-Around Final.
Byers helped the U.S. team achieve a four-year streak in the Olympic women's gymnastics personal omnipotence, and she personally won five medals at the Olympics, further confirming that she was the generation, and perhaps the best gymnast in history.
When he saw his total score, Byers couldn't help tears. She finally ended the long journey.
Balls has therefore joined the ranks of "decades of athletes" like Michael Phelps, who promoted sports in their respective fields to new heights:
Byers, who has dominated the field for the last three years, has won 15 world championships, including ten gold medals. She has been working hard every day to achieve higher accuracy. "Byers is the best gymnast I've ever seen," said Mary Lou Retton, 1984 Olympic champion.
There's still a final game in Brazil, but the game is not so much a match between Byers and other gymnasts as it is between herself and the pressure of great expectations.
If Balls doesn't have a full gold medal back to her home in Springlin, Texas, everyone will be very disappointed.
Simon Biles (left), from the United States, hugged each other, and they won gold and silver medals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August (Thursday).
Byers cut his first gold medal on Tuesday, giving a surprise tribute to the retiring national coach Martha Karolyi.
Although Byers insisted he did not plan for the future during his year-long title, it was not exactly the case.
A part of Balls's free gymnastics-including that part of her iconic churn, with Latin music-is what she often listens to when she has only one street from the Rio Olympics venue.
It's no coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents during the baby period and was spotted by the mother of Aimee Boorman during a field trip to the gym, has now grown into a strong force.
Since the summer of 2013, Balls has not lost his hand in all-round games, and as long as he wants to win, she will surely win.
Mustafana's little lead after two rotation is just an illusion.
Balance beam and free gymnastics two projects defending world champion Balls wait in wait.
Her balance beam scored 15.433, with free gymnastics scoring 15.933.
While waiting for the final score to come out, Leisman gently picked up Byers. When Byers learned that he had achieved the dream, he left tears.
Lyman's performance was a bit like a revenge for four years ago, when she tied third, but lost to Mustafana in the runoff.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, who was dubbed "Grandma" by the Americans, is far ahead.
She kissed the crowd at the end of the free gymnastics and announced the return, but such a return had sometimes seemed to be in doubt.
Byers was only 19. Since earlier this week, the news has spread viral on Twitter. As far as Byers is concerned, his life has been given new meaning.
The 6-year-old Mahaj Brown was spared in the Philadelphia shooting
A six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, a six-year-old child in the city's second medium shot this week, police said.
The child's grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child who had been shot was Mahaj Brown.
They said there were multiple gunshot wounds to Brown's groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but the child was sober on his way to hospital.
"He got a lot of guilt, and the little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother, Delorees Melendez, told the television station.
I can't believe it.
The boy was in critical condition at the hospital and had been undergoing multiple operations.
His family told the television station that the child was expected to recover.
He was supposed to start the first grade at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who had been shot in the Germantown area.
Of the other three people who were shot, two were 29 and one was 32.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims was in critical condition; the other two victims were in stable condition.
The child and the 29-year-old victim were found on the front seat of the car, the television station said.
Two other victims were not in the vehicle and police were investigating whether there were gunmen among the injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like multiple gunmen exchanged fire.
A number of offensive weapons shell casings have been found at the scene, which allows them to infer that they are using different offensive weapons.
Judging by this, this is undoubtedly an ongoing battle.
There are shell casings on the sidewalk on both sides of the street.
"So it's clear that there were multiple armed men on the scene at the time," Philadelphia police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
There are many houses and vehicles damaged in the area.
Arrests have not yet been carried out, and police are said to be watching the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, there was also a six-year-old child (girl) who was shot in the arm by a stray bullet while playing on the doorstep of the West Oak Lane community.
She is currently recovering and the police are still pursuing the suspects.
Why do we need Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie
That's how I evaluate this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team for more than one reason.
First, since 1984, I've gone to every summer Olympics, but the United States has never been so dominant.
Second, the gymnastics team has three excellent gymnasts-Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, who have been inspiring many girls of color.
The composition of the team is a source of pride for all, as it contains Aly Raisman of Judaism and Madison Kocan, the Catholic Church.
The team finally looked like the American team.
It also cemented the top position of black and Latino women in the sport.
The leading female gymnasts have been African American for the past four years.
Last year, Simon and Gabrielle ranked first and second.
It's too bad.
The United States was cheered by the fact that Gabriel Douglas "unexpectedly" became an Olympic champion at the last Olympics.
Today, the world can witness the superb performance of three world champions Simon Byers, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez.
On Thursday, Simon helped the US team achieve four straight caps on the Women's Individual All-Around Project.
Her team-mate, Ali Lesman, won the silver medal.
We got to the top of the sport, but this was not the case in the gymnastics teaching class in the United States.
Simon, Gabriel and Laurie went to the Olympic team in the same way as Ali and Madison.
They are the "ultimate five-person group," as the next Olympic gymnastics team will be made up of four gymnasts, the last year of Marta Karolyi.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, with gymnasts training mainly at private gymnastics clubs, and their parents need to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, games and hotel costs (including related costs for coaches and gymnasts and family members), and the list of costs is growing.
Most of the gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can provide support for the industry.
All the training of the gymnasts is done at these clubs and is a long-term expensive expense for the gymnasts' families.
Aimee Boorman, the coach of Balls, and Maggie Haney, the coach of Hernandez, have been coaching them since the two gymnasts began to practice gymnastics.
We have to bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to countless young girls affected by Simon, Gabriel and Laurie.
Twenty years ago, I set up my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we offer free, cheap gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Hispanic Americans) in black residential areas and develop national and even world championships.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this learning opportunity and will benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Gymnastics helps to develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, and helps to cultivate hard-working spirit, self-discipline and determination.
These can bring lifelong benefits to a person's health, education and work success.
Inspired by the team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in sports is significant, especially for girls.
It was an emotional moment.
Thanks to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabrielle and Madison for their wonderful display of "girl power" in winning Olympic group gold medals, and for inspiring so many young girls of all backgrounds to open the way to health, strength and success.
Junior doctors plan to launch further strikes after dismissing Jeremy Hunt's offer
Ministers initially hoped to end the change-induced dispute by accepting a modified contract from the British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 junior doctors involved in the vote objected to the contract.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract, saying the NHS was currently in a "vacuum zone" and that a slight delay would damage the interests of employees and patients.
The new contract first mentions changes to junior doctors overnight and weekend working practices to improve care in irregular working hours.
In a statement last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA junior doctors committee, said in a statement: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, with particular concern that it will exacerbate the current labor crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
It's only eight weeks before the first doctors sign the new contract, and we need to make progress, not much time.
The BMA struggled to resolve the dispute through negotiations, but everyone was reluctant to participate, and sometimes the government responded with silence.
Still, just last month we got the promise of Jeremy Hunt, who said his door was always open.
"Jeremy Hunt now needs to take action to remove enforcement and address junior doctors" concerns.
If he doesn't, junior doctors have made it clear they are ready to take further labor action.
The last strike, which took place at the end of April, led to nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointment extensions as nurses and consultants covered the doctor on the picket line.
Ministers initially hoped to end the change-triggered dispute by accepting a modified contract from the BMA.
The BMA wants to get better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Emplers, called on junior doctors not to stage any further strikes.
Mr Mortimer said: "Labour action has had little effect, but instead it has put pressure on teams and services that have already poured out, leading to concerns, worries and confusion among patients, care workers and their families."
We have been negotiating with the junior doctors' committee over the past two months and, along with the Department of Health and other departments, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and reporting of whistleblowing.
Employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics-such as deployment, flexibility in training, other training for those who are re-inducted after a career break, training costs, common understanding of the syllabus, study leave and gender pay differences in the medical field, which illustrate the importance attached by employers, the Health Education England and the Department of Health to the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
2 pounds a day can reduce the threat of heart attack
Officials have suggested that a drug of 2 pounds a day should be extended to more patients and extended medication time, after which thousands of heart patients will benefit from the drug.
Anticoagulant can reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence in patients with heart disease.
The drug, which lasts 12 months after a heart attack, can reduce the risk of a stroke or heart attack again.
The National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), a regulator under the NHS, advises patients to continue taking drugs for four years in order to further reduce the risk of heart vascular disease.
But now NHS regulators, NICE, suggest that patients be given sustained medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of heart vascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease each year, and a quarter of them continue to experience a relapse or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty substances forming plaque on the wall of the arteries.
If the plaque is disconnected, it can lead to a clot, which in turn prevents blood flow into the heart and causes a heart attack.
If the thrombus moves, it goes into the bloodstream, blocking blood flow into the brain, leading to stroke.
Patients who have experienced a heart attack have a higher risk of having a heart attack again.
It was made by British company AstraZeneca, sold by Brilique as a commodity name, to reduce the risk of thrombosis by reducing the formation of clots.
The NICE guidance, released today, recommended that patients take 90 mg of replacement for 12 months, after three years taking 60 mg of cargrel and two aspirin a day.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Although there are effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of patients with a history of heart attack have a relapse or stroke, often with severe consequences."
Fear of relapse can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that taking aspirin with aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence and stroke in patients who have experienced heart attacks.
We are deeply gratified that the interim recommendation for Cargray will provide more treatment options for tens of thousands of people who benefit.
The draft guidance does not recommend the continued use of its treatment after this deadline, given the limited information on the efficacy and safety of the replacement card after three years, especially the risk of bleeding.
Computer culture makes "election fraud" popular in Muslim areas
Lutfur Rahman, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was sacked last year for corruption, prompting a government report to be published.
The culture of "political correctness" has turned a blind eye to widespread electoral fraud in the Muslim community, an anti-lethal government report reveals today.
Sir Eric Pickles, the former cabinet secretary, accused police, electoral regulators and town halls of turning a blind eye to evidence of abuse of the election because of "excessive sensitivity to racial division and religious issues."
The former minister of community affairs, the current anti-corruption executive, said the practice of terrorizing voters with religious positions was bad and that police should be allowed to set up a cordon outside the polling station to protect the frightened electorate.
He advised voters to carry identity documents when they voted to confirm their identity.
At present, voters only have to give their own name and address.
The report even suggests applying indelible ink on the voters' fingers to prevent someone from voting twice.
Sir Eric said the protection of whistleblowers should be increased.
He called for increased media access to parliamentary documentation and decisions taken by non-official committees or working groups.
"It's not just about preventing election fraud, it's about protecting local governments from the widespread culture of corruption and the poisoning of financial scams that are closely linked to it," he said.
The report comes after Downing Street asked to be released after the Townsend Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special Electoral Tribunal ruled that there was a string of corruption and violations committed by Mayor Rahman, who should be removed from office.
The court found that Rahman was "very happy to abuse" the religious feelings of the Muslim community and was silent about the sword referring to his allegations of racial discrimination and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "claimed in the campaign that giving him a vote is a religious duty of loyalty to Muslims."
As many as 300 votes are doubtful, and it may be that voters fake others to vote.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of election fraud across the country.
He particularly warned of mail election fraud, and senior members of the Muslim community were said to have put pressure on voters to vote for their designated candidates.
Sir Eric (pictured) gave a number of suggestions on clearing the voting mechanism, including taking good ID cards to confirm their identity
"The evidence suggests that senior members, particularly in the background communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh, put pressure on vulnerable groups in some minority communities, especially women and young people, to vote on their own will," he said in the report.
"Because of the excessive sensitivity to racial divisions and religious" political correctness, "they fear that state institutions will turn a blind eye to such behaviour."
Sir Eric has proposed 50 proposals to clean up the electoral mechanism, including a ban on political activists dealing with mail voting documents to stop "voting gains."
The report also calls for strict registration of information to prevent the electoral roll from being used for immigration and welfare fraud. Theresa May is also considering the report.
The proposals include requiring voters to show identity papers before voting.
Apply indelible ink on voters' fingers after the vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Systematic verification of the nationality of voters to ensure voting qualifications.
The validity period for automatic mail voting requests is set at three years.
Political activists and militants are prohibited from dealing with completed mailing polls and mailing voting envelopes.
Police were authorized to set up a cordon around the polling station.
The modification of the provisions of the law makes it easier to accuse the persons concerned of intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983.
It is illegal to stipulate that taking pictures at a polling station is illegal.
Provision is made for the use of English only in polling stations (except in the Welsh area).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff strictly enforce the requirement that "voters go to the voting hall alone."
Sir Eric denounced the Metropolitan Police, saying they were "surprised" by the fact that they had not filed any criminal charges after the incident at Tower Hamlets.
"There has been a lot of corruption and wrongdoing by Rahman and his election officers, so they have been disqualified by the Electoral Tribunal," he said.
He is unquestionably guilty in many ways, according to the standards of criminal proof.
He also criticized the "tick box check" of the town hall election registration department.
Sir Eric said: "Last year the court's verdict on Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call for everyone."
Our country has a glorious tradition of "the mother of Parliament," but the private sneaking election fraud and hindrances of some institutions are a source of concern and a threat to this good reputation.
The cyclist who looks like Princess Kate and the other celebrities who hit the face of the Rio Olympics have been pursued
This week, Pauline Ferrand Prevot, a French cyclist who looks like Princess Kate at the 2016 Rio Olympics, was heavily sought by viewers.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is not the only gold contender to hit a face celebrity at the summer Olympics, at least social media doesn't think so.
So, to mark the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that appeared on the screen at the time, FEMAIL sorted out a list of Olympians who hit the Hollywood star.
Hunter and Wolf: American man archer Brady Ellison (left) has been likened to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
Many netizens soon found out that one of the archers was the twin brother of Leonardo DiCaprio, in addition to the players who hit Kate on the bike track.
The American men's archery player, Brian Ellison, has caused a huge stir on social media since his image of the Wall Street werewolf star came to light on Twitter.
In fact, the archer noticed the hype on social media and admitted that someone said he looked like Xiao Li.
"I think I don't look very much like a beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome playboy, so I think it's a compliment to me."
One of the most popular contrasts at the 2012 London Olympics will no doubt find more parallels this year: Greg Rutherford, the British long jumper, looks like the famous actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Aliya Mustafina, a Russian gymnast with a pair of big eyes, was referred to Gloria Estefan, a Cuban-American singer.
In the swimming pool, for years, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been taken to compare with Matthew Morrison, starring Glee.
Replacement: The user thinks Nathan Adrian is the "campaign version" of the "Dream Space" actor
The other pair were compared with tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, whose eyebrows and lips looked very similar.
The silver-winning Russian swimmer, Yulia Efimova, and actor Anna McCord have the same copper-colored skin and blonde hair, while the U.S. team's Ni Jia is compared to "the campaign version of Joseph Gorgan Levitt."
Female: Football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar faces and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user is happy to find that others have seen the similarities
Communication Theory: According to the user, the pair looks like maybe for a reason
A Twitter user has recently been happy to claim online that "other netizens also think that Hopper Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look exactly the same."
Indeed, the American football star and the bloodthirsty forensics star have very similar faces and eyes.
Other popular contrasts include Kerri Walsher Jennings, whose smile is almost exactly the same as that of actress Laura Linney; and the gold-medal gymnast, Gabby Douglas, whose beautiful and brilliant smile is the same as the smile of Gabrielle Union, the star of the Bloom.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for comments from Chinese swimmers "as slow as pigs"
On Wednesday, Byron MacDonald's comments about the 14-year-old's fourth place in the women's 4x 200m freestyle relay race angered viewers watching the BBC's Olympic live broadcast
A spokesman for the Canadian broadcaster CBC said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer would "swim faster than the stink" in the race and ended up "as slow as a pig," after CBC was forced to apologise.
Narrator Byron MacDonald made some of his own views at the end of the women's 4x 200m freestyle relay race, when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
"The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake," said Byron, a member of the CBC commentator's team, who wore the "non-ferrous glasses" comment.
Because of the excitement, it began to swim faster than the stench, but then it was as slow as a pig.
Thanks to her.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, Ai Yan, swam the second best, with 1 point 57 seconds 79-behind Canada's Taylor Ruck, 1.61 seconds, and then the Canadian team narrowed the gap with China.
Viewers across Canada were shocked by the tone and wording of the commentator, who quickly responded to the network
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "The CBC commentator said China's 14-year-old swimmer was" slow like a pig "?"
The idiot didn't realise it was live.
"The 14-year-old Chinese little girl made a stupid mistake," said Ai Yan, a Chinese teenager who attended the women's 4x 200m freestyle relay race final.
Twitter's criticism of Byron MacDonald quickly went viral on Twitter, with many asking for its exit from the explanation.
When Twitter users heard Byron McDonnell was slow to respond, they didn't stop it.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Java Byron MacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and your words and deeds make us all sound like a bunch of racists. "It's really annoying.
Shortly afterwards, CBC radio host Scott Russel apologized for Byron's remarks in a live broadcast, saying: "We apologise for comments on the performance of the live swimmers."
"We are sorry to have this anachronistic wording."
CBC apologised more than 90 times to Twitter users who responded to the remarks
Another commentator, Scott Russell, also apologised on behalf of Byron
CBC then copied their apology to more than 90 Twitter users protesting Byron's explanation
The channel also quickly made an apology and issued a statement.
We are extremely sorry to say this and live it out.
Last night, we acted quickly to apologise to viewers who watched us live, as well as to our audience on social media.
It needs to be explained that Byron's explanation is aimed at the swimmer's performance, but not against her personally.
That said, the wording was really inappropriate, and Byron was deeply sorry for it.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologised in a live broadcast, saying his words did not mean any physical assault, and attempted to justify his remarks.
"I want to take some time to apologise for the comments I made last night after the women's relay race," he said on the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I just comment on the swimmer's performance, not against its individual."
"Of course, I have no disrespect, I'm sorry."
Primark customers were angry at a woman who was cheeky to try his underwear in the middle of the store
A woman took off her underwear in the middle of a Primark store, and customers in the shop didn't know where to look.
To make matters worse, she also looked at how she looked and then took off her underwear and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelves and eventually tried four underwear in the store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The woman kept trying his underwear at the Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone and then put it back on the shelves
Jenny Davidson, who was also in the store at the time, said that after trying on the underwear, the mysterious woman "got dressed again and then went out of the store and bought nothing."
"Everyone can't believe what they see," she said.
She was standing in the middle of the store, taking off a pair of underwear from the shelf, taking off her tight pants and panties, and then wearing it.
"She didn't try to find hidden places to try-she just stood there, it was cheeky."
"When she took her underwear off again, everyone was stunned. Obviously, she was still unhappy because she put her underwear back on the shelf."
After that, she tried three more like this, and finally found that it wasn't what she liked, and then dressed again and went out of the shop.
"She didn't seem to care that someone was looking at her-or didn't think who would eventually buy the underwear she tried on."
Ms Davidson, who lives in Kent town (33), said: "It felt sick to think that someone would buy underwear that someone else had gone through and had not been washed."
It happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: 'After she left, the clerk obviously had to deal with the underwear, fortunately.'
"I hate buying a new underwear, but I find another woman trying to get through and not being washed."
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is already aware of what happened on August 9 (Tuesday) in our Folkestone store."
All the problematic goods have been laid down.
How to use gamma to protect yourself in a gun attack
The world is dangerous, but the video on Dailymail.com may give you a little sense of security.
We asked Rhon Mizrachi, a master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, to find out how to deal with the gunman at close range.
Whether he is from the front or behind you, the video will teach you how to win.
If the shooter comes close to you from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and "clear the line," Mizrachi said.
Then, hold the gun with the forearm and shoulders and hit the attacker's face with your elbow.
The knee was then topped with the knee, and when the attacker bent over the pain, turned the gun in his hand, hit his face with the barrel and reserve gun, and kept the weapon on him.
If the shooter is close to the front, it also uses similar techniques-to keep your body out of the line of fire, seize the gun and turn the muzzle so that the gunman can't fire.
At the same time, weigh the weight on the gun and hit the attacker's chest and turn the muzzle from his grip and point the gun at him.
It sounds complicated?
Look at the video to see how Mizrachi actually did it.
But remember, if you're not a master of gamma, the safest way to get rid of a robbery is to hand over the cash.
A rogue family destroyed the low-rent house in Saltash, Cornwall, before being driven away
A hooligan family who had been deported for fear of neighbours had damaged the low-cost rental house before leaving, resulting in a loss of 50,000 pounds.
After a long string of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, were driven out of a low-rent house in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being forced to remove from the residence, housing association officials were surprised to find that there had been serious damage here.
The walls were full of holes, the floor was torn, the rubbish was strewn all over the floor, and the walls were daubed.
After being deported, the family has been moving and is said to be currently living in a private home
Donna McEvoy, home manager at Cornwall Housing Association, said she was concerned that the house could not be saved.
"For people living here, it's a nightmare and I don't think people can live like that," she said.
There are a lot of things that need to be weighed right now, because the house is likely to be a less good element in Cornwall.
The family is notorious and their names are equally notorious.
The couple had three sons who would live here from time to time. Police said the family's acts of terror included using baseball bats to fight on the streets, terrorizing nearby residents, drug use, drug trafficking, shouting, bickering, and swearing.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant named Skeldon received a resolution on anti-social behaviour.
In this house, which is likely to be demolished, many of the rooms are long-laid waste
In this room, which once traded drugs, the floor was lifted
Neighbors say they often see them fighting in the streets and often call the police
After the 11-week extension allowed them to move away voluntarily, the Cornwall Housing Association forcibly removed her from the residence with her husband this week.
The neighbours, who were finally relieved, cheered, saying that the previous life was a hell of a hell.
"They don't care about anyone," said one neighbor.
We lived next door to them for 20 years and have been so bad.
We've seen the police boarding the door countless times.
"We can't sleep this morning."
We got up early because it was so quiet-we weren't used to it!
It was great that they had finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, community executive manager of the Cornwall Housing Association, said the family did not cooperate well with the local government.
The family lived in the house for 20 years and the police visited regularly
Rubbish and old toys were thrown on the side of the low-rent room
He added: "It is regrettable that the tenant did not take any responsibility for her behaviour with her family, and that the eviction was the last consideration of the Cornwall Housing Association."
It's a very difficult case to deal with, because their behaviour is extremely extreme, and what they do must be a great fear for the neighbors.
I thank my team for the work it has done, as well as for Devon and Cornwall Police as well as members of the community who are brave enough to provide us with information.
I hope the move will bring some comfort to neighbors and convey the message that we will never tolerate anti-social behaviour.
Mr Fitzpatrick said their three sons had lived in the house at different times, but also said they were all in their 20s.
After they were removed, a dirty mattress was thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms
Housing Association workers will soon clean up piles of rubbish around the house
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, and also found scales, drug paraphernalia and 1,700 pounds of cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of Class B drugs and drug trafficking.
She claims the money was used to buy a tombstone for the son, Lee Skeldon, who died in the crash in 2013.
It is understood that after being homeless, Tanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of the house were painted with graffiti.
Police said they would deport tenants who defied the tenant rules.
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the expulsion sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to defy tenant rules.
"This warning is aimed at people who think their actions will not be blamed, as well as those who have been devastated by such behaviour," she said.
Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate crime and anti-social behaviour, and they will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Reid: Hillary Clinton if elected president will nominate Garland to the Supreme Court
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said he was sure that if Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was elected president, she would nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have been blocking confirmation of Garland since President Barack Obama nominated Garland in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would choose the man to replace Antonin Scalia, the late Supreme Court judge.
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he predicted Hillary would choose to "have some credibility" in Garland.
A spokeswoman for Reid later said Reid didn't talk directly to Hillary about whether he would nominate Garland and said he was just guessing.
He praised Garland and said Hillary's team didn't want to "stir up" because of the new election.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeal of the United States of America.
Reid said the Republicans who stopped the Garland nomination were "favourites" and "achievers" of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit to be president.
"Treats": Naked calendar "Men and women love"
The Treats magazine will work hand-in-hand with photographer David Bellemere to shoot a set of inspiration from the 2017 calendar of Pirelli in the 1970s.
This time, they plan to look for a new generation of top models for its 2017NU Muses calendar, not the famous nudity.
Steve Shaw, president of Treats, said earlier this year that their nude-dominated magazines were different from the old "Playboy" because "the latter is facing men."
And we are facing women.
Obviously, he thinks this set of calendars is the same.
"We need to show the timeless and classic nudity that makes women and men feel at ease, and this time it's inspired," Shaw said at a calendar referral conference.
Women will be happy to be involved in the shooting because it is a beautiful piece of art.
Models can apply for photos online, as well as for public recruitment sites in Los Angeles and New York.
Video report shows that small head sleeping shark is the longest-lived vertebrate
Greenland Shark is the longest-lived vertebrate on Earth, scientists said.
Julius Nielsen, who has been studying sharks, says the age of a female small head sleeping shark is expected to be between 272 and 512 years old, with a body length of five meters.
French court dismissed petition to dismantle shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has dismissed a petition by the Calais government to dismantle dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the "Jungle" camp, which currently houses thousands of refugees.
At the court's hearing this week, the Calais government argued that the French government should have the right to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops in the camp, where people sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, provide haircuts, and sell tea at 50 cents (40 pence) in makeshift restaurants or sell basic meals at a few euros.
The governor's office believes these places should be removed because they are a non-taxable parallel economy, and there are fire and health risks.
Humanitarian groups have said to the court that these shops and restaurants are extremely important because the free food provided by state-backed associations and other groups simply cannot meet the needs of growing refugees in the camp.
These makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for people in need, they said.
A court in Lille ruled there was no legal basis to deport the operators of the 72 temporary stores, but said the governor's concerns were "entirely understandable."
Judge Jean Francois Molla says the role of these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants is far more than simply providing food to refugees who "live in extremely dangerous conditions."
These places, he said, are calm points of convergence between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened with demolition was the "Jungle Book Kids" cafe in the camp, which provides 200 food, English and French classes a day, and offers asylum advice for hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the cafe.
Closing the cafe "will be a big disaster for these children (many children are only eight years old)," wrote a letter to the Guardian.
The two charities, Help Refugees and L & Auberge des Migrts, predicted on Friday that the number of refugees in the Jungle camp had broken through 9,000, the highest level since the surge in refugee numbers in the summer.
"This 5,000 yuan funding, understanding my immediate needs."
Zhou Fong, a girl in poverty-stricken village in the village of Yuyuan County, has received a letter of acceptance from the University of Nanhua.
Just as she was worried about the cost of admission, on August 9, the county committee gave her $5,000 in time.
In the last few days, county departments have also implemented 283.08 million yuan in school funding for more than 690 poor students.
At the same time, the family's economic situation is particularly difficult, and through the organization of social donations and other forms of education to help them complete their studies.
Hua Yuan this year integrated student funding of more than 50 million yuan, the fiscal self-financing of more than 2.5 million yuan, by the financial department in accordance with the prescribed time-limit for poor students in the bank card.
"I thought my dad died, and my brother and I didn't go to college and didn't expect the county to solve the difficulties for us in time," she said gratefully.
As of August 8, more than 21 million yuan had been implemented in the first half of this year for 13,140 poor students.
All the poor students in this county have done their best to assist and supplement the supplement.
At the scene, the reporter saw that a large container truck was leaning against the fast lane under the command of the police, the container box fell on the green road and the roadside was smashed by a 2-centimetre deep pit.
According to Xinhua News Agency, Australia's NSW government announced on November 11 that it would spend $200 million (about $154 million) on the biggest repairs since the famous Sydney Opera House was built.
The NSW government said the repairs would not change the shell shape of the opera house.
The Sydney Opera House, one of Sydney's landmark buildings, was designed by Danish architect Jon Utersson and was built in 1973 and receives about 8 million visitors a year.
Rory Jeff, managing director of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, believes the Sydney Opera House will use the revamp as "one of the best concert halls in the world."
Non-Beijing citizens who have resided in Beijing for more than six months and are eligible for legal and stable employment, legal stable residence and continuous study conditions in Beijing may apply for a residence permit.
Recently, Beijing's Provisional Regulations on Residence Permit have been introduced, which means that the "temporary residence permit" will be upgraded to a "residence permit."
The shift from "temporary residence certificate" to "residence permit" means Beijing will shift from "management" to multi-directional service for non-Beijing resident population, according to the head of the relevant department.
The reporter today learned from the State Administration of Taxation that by the end of June this year, tax authorities at various levels had published 2,470 cases of "blacklist" of tax violations.
It is understood that in July 2014, the State Administration of Taxation, in the first step in the central government function, issued the "Measures for the Publication of Information on Major Tax Illegal Cases" in conjunction with the Tax Credit Management Measures.
Not only the illegal facts of these cases, the legal basis, the handling of penalties will be published, but the basic information of the illegal parties and those responsible for the relevant intermediary agencies will also be included in the "blacklist."
The government departments such as quality inspection, finance and customs have also taken relevant disciplinary measures against the "blacklisted" parties.
"Credit repair mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of tax credit system and even the whole social credit system, which marks the development and maturity of our social credit system."
"Environmental problems are shown in the atmosphere, water and soil pollution, but the root is still in the production lifestyle."
In Jiangsu Province, for example, land development was as high as 21% in 2015, the highest in the provinces and autonomous regions of the country.
Therefore, the problem of high pollution, large energy and multi-occupied land has not been fundamentally addressed from the transformation of production lifestyle.
On the one hand, from the creation of all kinds of ecological environment at all levels in Jiangsu Province, the absolute advantage is the first place in the country; but on the other hand, the resource environment carries a lot of pressure.
In order to promote ecological environment protection and governance, we need to fundamentally promote the transformation of production lifestyle and promote the transformation of people's livelihood through the construction of ecological civilization.
On 11 November, at Lianyungang Port, 42 pieces of wind turbine produced by the National Electric Group were shipped for export to South Africa.
Since last year, a total of 163 wind power projects have been exported to South Africa from Lianyungang port.
Third-party companies (non-Chinese companies) commissioned by the Organizing Committee (non-Chinese companies) in Sao Paulo, Brazil, are about 75 kilometers from the city of Sao Paulo.
In order to urge the manufacturers to complete as soon as possible, the Chinese Consulate General in Sao Paulo organized special personnel to go to the factory and work in depth.
After 30 hours of overtime, the factory finally completed the Chinese flag production and loaded the car, which would have required four or five working days ahead of schedule.
The flag, which is expected to arrive in Rio on 11 November, will be sent to various Olympic venues after receiving the flag, and the whole process will be completed under the supervision of the Chinese embassy and consulate in Brazil.
More than 180 Shanghai enterprises were invited to participate in the Shanghai International Conference Centre, and more than 180 Shanghai enterprises were invited to participate in the Shanghai International Conference Center.
The total investment of 20 projects was $8,063 million, involving new sources of energy, new materials, modern services and other industries.
Qingdao is the 12th in the country and the first pilot city in Shandong Province for paid use and trading.
On 11 th, a number of enterprises came to Qingdao sewage rights trading center to submit the discharge rights requisition, the requisition will pay the paid fee.
The completion of the deal will also herald the launch of the Qingdao emission rights trading pilot, which will also be the province's emissions trading first list and the national city-level emissions trading first list.
On the morning of 11 th, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Double-peach Fine Chemicals (Group) Co. Ltd. came to the Qingdao Sewage Rights Trading Center to submit the discharge right.
The enterprise is located in Qingdao old city factory area at the end of last year, environmental protection moved to flat new factory area.
Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, construction project environmental impact report and other materials, the Qingdao discharge power reserve and trading service center began the preliminary examination of the application material.
According to the collection standards determined by the prices and finance departments of Qingdao, the estimated initial discharge fee is about 64.12 million yuan, and the staff will complete the approval within seven working days.
The completion of the deal will also herald the launch of the Qingdao emission rights trading pilot, will also be the province's emissions trading first list and the national city-level emission rights trading first.
Zhao Xiuping said that the enterprise environmental protection has invested up to 4 billion, the surface amount is huge, but has a great influence on the enterprise management concept, social benefits, and opened up space for enterprise innovation management.
On the same day, Qingdao Four Fang Xincheng Bus Accessories Co. Ltd. also came to the annual production of 4,200 high-speed high-speed rail and moving parts of the interior accessories project requisitioned emission rights.
The project belongs to a mechanical processing enterprise, and the initial discharge right is 0.514 tons / year of COD (COD) and 0.052 tons / year of ammonia nitrogen (NOX).
The paid use and trading of air pollutant discharge rights are the key industrial enterprises for power and thermal production in the city.
The existing sewage units that have obtained EIA prior to January 1, 2016 are not subject to paid royalties.
"Paid access to sewage is not equal to the power of illegal discharge and is not free to discharge pollutants."
The deputy director of the Qingdao Environmental Protection Agency, Han Hongyan, said that if illegal sewage discharge and excess discharge were to be punished in accordance with the relevant regulations, it would not be possible to allow illegal enterprises to circumvent the penalty by buying the right to discharge.
That is, through legal means to crack down on environmental violations, severely punish enterprises for excess discharge behavior, so as to protect the environment and safeguard public health.
Now enterprises, for their own benefit, raise the enthusiasm of pollution, cherish the limited emission rights, reduce pollutant discharge.
With the drive of economic interests, reducing the discharge of pollutants from the government's compulsory behavior to the enterprise's conscious market behavior, thus truly achieve the purpose of protecting the environment, protecting nature and safeguarding the public health.
Pollutant discharge rights, also known as "emission rights," are the right to discharge pollutants, referring to the right of emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment in accordance with the amount allocated by the government.
This right is essentially the right of polluters to take possession, use and gain of environmental capacity resources.
Next, on the premise that the total amount of pollutant discharge does not exceed allowable emissions, the amount of pollutant discharge can be transferred between the various sources of pollution through currency exchange.
Since 1968, the United States has applied it to the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources since it was proposed by American economist Dyers in 1968.
Our country began pilot in 2007, and there are 14 provinces (districts and cities) in Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces.
According to the Russian Defense Ministry, to assist the six strategic bombers in carrying out air strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria, a number of Russian warplanes backed up from the air base in Syria's Mehmim Air Force.
On February 22 this year, the United States and Russia reached an agreement on a cease-fire between the parties to the Syrian conflict, which began on 27 February.
Under the agreement, the cease-fire does not include military strikes against terrorist organizations identified by the UN Security Council, such as the Islamic State "Support Front."
Russia will continue to build relevant military infrastructure at the base, and the living conditions of Russian military personnel will be guaranteed accordingly.
He also said those forces would extend to Russia without a crackdown on extremist forces.
While Russia and the West have not agreed on a joint fight against Syria's extremist forces, Russia will strengthen its cooperation with Syria, Iran and Iraq in this regard.
In September 2015, Russia began a military strike against the Syrian extremist forces at the invitation of the Syrian government.
On March 15 this year, Russia's main military force in Syria began to withdraw, but the Russian side promised to continue to maintain its presence at the Haimmim Air Force Base and the Tartus naval base.
In the case of old house freshmen and successful townships, Ho Pui has done a good demonstration: To inherit a century old house, and also to tell a story of the inheritance of land.
Today, an average of 100,000 people come to bamboo mountains each year, or bring a variety of ideas, or seek inner peace.
In fact, the relationship between the country and the city should be accompanied by one another, like a mother and a child, without strength and strength, and no one who needs to rule who should be warm.
There is no fixed pattern for rural development, but the change in rural self-development is difficult, and the most important thing should be to get the right people to the countryside.
Shanghai Songjiang District transportation department recently used electronic police to control the driver to drive a mobile phone, a week seized more than 30.
With the popularity of smartphones, mobile phones are becoming more and more fun, brushing microletters, microblogging and even playing games, shopping for Taobao have become the norm, and many people seem to have to stay away from their phones for a while and can't stop.
The Road Traffic Safety Act explicitly prohibits driving on a mobile phone and defines it as "an obstacle to safe driving."
Unfortunately, this phenomenon has not been punished for reasons such as the violation of the law and the difficulty of obtaining evidence, and the legal provisions have almost become the norm.
If the authorities are determined to "declare war" on the drive to play mobile phones, this measure will surely be curbed.
In order to ensure that the file information is complete and effective, it is necessary to maintain the management of household registration files and establish electronic and paper files on a case-by-case basis.
The public security organ shall, in a timely manner, inform the relevant departments of the situation concerning the registration of persons without accounts.
The policy measures that are inconsistent with the spirit of this implementation will be subject to a centralized clean-up, and a serious modification of the amendment shall be resolutely repealed.
The 48-year-old Wang Xue-fen is spraying the pear tree with a worker in the collective shed of East Lin village in Taiyuan City.
In the village, 150 acres of orchards, more than 10 species, require only 12 workers plus 1 technical engineer.
Fifty thousand dollars last year, like my age, I can't get the money if I work in a factory.
Last year, the village's village income reached 22 million yuan, of which total agricultural income accounted for nearly half.
Village Clerk Su Qi Fang: The per capita land cultivation area is rising every year, just 50 mu, now more than 100 mu; mu benefits are increasing every year, and the income of professional farmers is growing every year.
The biggest bright spot of the collective economic reform in southern Jiangsu province is to clarify the property rights of collective operating assets in rural areas and explore the separation of political and political affairs.
In July 2015, 14 rural economic cooperation organizations in Anzhen Street, Sishan District, Wuxi City, and village village committees were "divided into account management," and village committees performed rural public affairs management, and cooperative organizations mainly engaged in operation.
Two institutions, two accounts, do not "cross the border" to prevent village cadres from participating in collective asset management corruption.
The deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Agriculture Committee said that Jiangsu will continue to push forward the reform of the community equity cooperation system, encourage the joint development of farmers and establish a mechanism for democratic power operation at the village level.
Zhu Ping: Further advance the reform forward, engage in community equity cooperation, quantify the assets to members, fixed to farmers, and form clear property rights.
Through the Internet +, the implementation of his right to know, the right to participate in decision-making and the supervision of democratic management, the three rights have been implemented to the farmers, and indeed made it into the operating mechanism of the standard share cooperation.
At present, the new collective economy in Jiangsu Province mainly forms the four development modes of asset leasing, enterprise share, agricultural development and joint development.
It is understood that overseas exhibition has become an important platform for the construction of "One Belt One Road" in Zhejiang Province.

Xiamen girl Zhang Binbin: "Hand-type beautiful" start shooting road career several times "reverse"
Zhang Dong-hong of Dongyuan Village in Xiang'an District, Xiamen, just a few days ago changed his home 29 inches of old TV to 65 inches of big TV.
The average farmer's daughter, Zhang Binbin, who won the final silver medal of the women's 50m rifle in the Rio Olympics on the 11th night.
On the 11th night, just before the new TV, the Zhang Dong-red couple and dozens of relatives and friends, together, witnessed the daughter's pursuit, from almost pre-qualifying to nearly a great reversal of the magical process.
In the game of the day, Zhang Bingbin, once ranked middle and lower, seemed far away from the final.
But parents and friends and relatives did not give up, kept on streaming, and saw that as the rest of the players finished, Zhang Bingbin rose all the way, eventually locked the final seat, and his home burst out of a cheer.
In the final, Zhang Binbin was once again in the post, the last few shots, the more stable, only the backward champion 0.2 ring to win silver.
Zhang Binbin, who is 27 years old this year, has nearly passed the hard-won silver medal in his 16-year-old shooting career.
His mother, Bruce, told reporters that as soon as they hesitated, Zhang Bingbin found a few "small lobbyists" in the village.
These "little lobbyists" are the same village children who were recommended for training at the same time, including Zhang Binbin's cousin.
Shortly after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin, for reasons such as family difficulties, returned to Xiang'an's school.
But after his Enlightenment coach Zhang Yjie repeated his work, Zhang Binbin returned to the Xiamen team.
After entering the provincial team, Zhang Binbin had been slow to enter the national team, once again because he couldn't see hope and returned home.
This time, not only Zhang Yjie coach, Xiamen shooting archery center and Fujian team leader and coach all come home, finally persuade Zhang Bingbin to return to the provincial team.
Like yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl's use insisted on a reversal of the path of shooting.
"The way each coach picked the players was different, and at the time I saw that Bingley's hand was very beautiful, and it was all at once."
Zhang Dong-hong also recalled that in the training test, the daughter, although not the best, but the number of rings is stable, which is also Zhang Bingbin's important reason to attract the coach.
In the course of training Zhang Bingbin, Zhang Yjie is the most impressed, is the peasant girl's input.
He recalled that Zhang Binbin entered the Xiamen shooting team more than a year later, the team carried out a lasting gun training, asked the players for half an hour not to move.
Bruce Zhang told reporters that daughter has always been a quiet, clever child, from childhood like painting and homemade hand toys,
"I would have made clothes and stitched up at home, and Bingley would have picked up some corners to be a doll."
She said that daughters often sew hand-made toys on their own, plus that she is good at drawing, from the doll's five officials to the clothes, and can always be lifelike.
As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and family gathered less, only holidays can go home, usually by telephone contact.
Parents say whether they meet or call, Zhang Binbin rarely says his hard work, more is talking to his parents about happy things.
When I can't see my daughter, my parents keep their daughter's paintings as a child, as well as the honours of the years.
Bruce Zhang showed his daughter's cartoon painting to reporters, "if not as a shooting athlete, she should still continue to draw."
And in Zhang Binbin's second floor living room, there was a cabinet filled with the medals, medals and certificates she had received.
Zhang Dong-hong puts the medals and medals in order, the certificate is unified into the folder preservation, "these are the honor of more than a dozen years of painstaking efforts, we all cherish it."
Recently, the Tzu-Hau Fund of Hebei Province sent 16,000 yuan consolation gold to Jingxing County small works, Taiwan head, Qiquan and other villages in the village of 6 families.
It is the fund's renewed condolences to the community for the revelation of "7.19 floods of children and young people and lonely old people."
7.19 Strong rainfall has caused multiple disasters in Hebei province, resulting in flooding in parts of the province and the death and disappearance of people.
Good people "old iron" due to help the community duty drainage unfortunate sacrifice, leaving 2-year-old young children and pregnant wife, good man "old iron" moving story touched the entire provincial city.
On August 4, Hebei Province Tzu Chi Fund staff and Hebei brand volunteers came to the good people's "old iron" home, handing over 3,200 yuan of love to the "old iron" family.
When the brand vice president, Ye Li, learned about the status quo of the "old iron" family, he immediately decided to carry out "love-selling" activities in the company's corporate members to help the "old iron" family get through.
Hebei Province Cixiao Fund, the full name of the Hebei Voluntary Service Foundation, Tzu Chi Foundation, launched by Hebei Brand Council Preparatory Committee, was established in August 2015.
According to the Hong Kong East Daily News on August 12, there are three major problems with diamond sales in the Mainland, including the selling price of the virtual diamond net, the weight of the dummy diamond, the aftermarket insecurity, etc.
While Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centers, the diamond cutting technology of local artisans is well-known, and the diamonds sold are strictly identified and are well received by mainland ladies.
"A small bag, held in the palm, a small pinch, worth nearly a million yuan," said Liu, who was involved in the purchase of diamonds, described to the Mainland media her experience in Antwerp this June.
She said she hid the diamond in her underwear, and went to the toilet and bath for a few days, and was very nervous to walk to sleep.
She called the diamond bought in Antwerp with a purchase price of about fifty-five thousand dollars per carat, and the retail price of the same quality diamonds in Xiamen is about $11, 000.
She has bought more than two percent of her purchase price, sold all the diamonds she bought, and made two hundred thousand yuan a year.
According to the Mainland Customs, diamonds are not subject to the goods or necessities of the trip, so they belong to the category of goods, which must be declared at the time of entry or exit, otherwise or listed as smuggling.
On 10 days local time, Downing Street, the UK's prime minister, announced: British Prime Minister Theresa May will spend the summer holidays in Switzerland, but did not disclose specific leave locations, according to foreign media.
There are media claims that after Britain's referendum Brexit, Britain's new prime minister opted for a "neutral" Swiss holiday on the continent, with some kind of policy symbolism.
The British Guardian commented that the symbolism represented by Switzerland's neutral state played a role in the choice of the British prime minister's first resort.
The Daily Telegraph commented that Theresa May had chosen to take a holiday in Switzerland, which was the first time a British prime minister had gone to Switzerland for a holiday after Mrs. Thatcher.
The choice between the two female prime ministers contrasts with Blair and Mr Cameron's two male prime ministers who like to go on holiday to warmer places.
It is reported that Britain's new prime minister, Theresa May, will return to London on August 24 after waiting for her to be a series of important jobs and activities.
The British Parliament will resume on September 5, and the debate will include online calls for a second Brexit referendum.
The British referendum on June 23 decided to take Brexit, but the new British prime minister did not want to start the Lisbon treaty by the end of the year.
There are 1,325 existing intangible cultural heritage projects in Huangshan City, and the number and quantity are the first in the province.

China's Mars program is coming
The mission of Mars exploration in our country is to be surrounded, landed and inspected once, and this form has never been in foreign countries.
The goal of our country's Mars exploration launch is to move around, land, inspect, and this task is very difficult.
Because Mars exploration takes 26 months to meet a time window, experts are working closely on engineering plans to launch the first Mars probe in our country in 2020.
Despite the fact that our aircraft have entered deep space, the completion of the Mars exploration mission remains indispensable, and the exploration of Mars means that China is entering the deep-space exploration era in real terms, according to Xu Dazhe.
"Every two or three years, there is a time when Mars is closest to Earth, and launching a Mars probe at this time point is the most energy-saving for the launch vehicle."
"Given the quality of the Mars probe, the launch mission will be completed by our Long March 5 launch vehicle."
The mission of Mars exploration in our country is to be surrounded, landed, and toured, which has never been done abroad, and has been intended to be surrounded and landed abroad, but the landing has failed.
Mars exploration involves a lot of technical fields and, in particular, while the spark car is a space probe, it has distinct features compared to the general space probe.
That is, the Mars probe must have the ability to determine the course of the journey and detect the danger.
Mr Pang, a five-member researcher at China Space Technology Group, said humans are so keen on Mars exploration because the exploration of Mars has important scientific, technological and other aspects, and even the future of mankind.
Mars has now become the planet with the highest degree of human research beyond Earth, and the history of human use of space probes for Mars exploration is almost throughout the history of human space.
As a result, humans want to build a living base on Mars one day and eventually emigrate to Mars, turning it into a second home for humans.
Plenty of signs also suggest that Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth, only after billions of years of evolution into the thin atmosphere, low temperatures, and water exhaustion.
As a result, exploration or manned landing on Mars can provide a plan for preventing the planet from becoming a second Mars that is difficult for humans to survive.
As of June 2016, a total of 114 lunar probes have been carried out around the globe and 43 fire stars have been detected.
However, from the 1990s to the present, humans have carried out 18 Mars exploration, while lunar exploration has been conducted only 14 times.
There are currently five Mars orbiter and two Mars roaming vehicles working, but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are working.
The world's space-faring nations have developed a detection scheme aimed at the Mars system, which shows that today's Mars exploration is hotter than lunar exploration.
On November 5, 2013, India launched its first Mars probe, "Mangaran," to become the first country in Asia to successfully detect Mars.
"Mangaran" is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral features of Mars and to explore whether there are methane and signs of life on Mars.
The hardest part of the task is that the aerodynamic shape and parachute slow down after the probe enters Mars' atmosphere has only one chance
The Mars exploration mission faces a number of technical challenges, according to Sun Zezhou, head of the Mars probe at the General Department of China Aerospace Science and Technology Group.
The atmospheric pressure on Mars is low, with only 1% of the atmospheric pressure on the earth's surface, with high uncertainty.
Scientists are not yet fully aware of factors such as its changes and the characteristics of storms.
Mars often forms dust storms similar to Earth's dust weather in the summer, which can lead to a sharp drop in the energy of the sun's rays, and the need to design a "dormant" model for the spark car to wait patiently for the dust storm to pass.
At the same time, the Mars atmosphere has a cutting effect on the sun's light, which poses a problem for the energy supply of Mars.
This requires the probe's solar wing area to be larger and needs to be constantly adjusted to focus on the direction of the sun.
Also, the surface gravity of Mars is only 38% of the Earth, but much more gravity than the surface of the moon, so the probe needs more power.
"The most central and difficult place for this Mars exploration mission is the process of aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration after the probe enters the Martian atmosphere, with only one chance to ensure success."
Sun Zezhou said that because the Earth is far from Mars, the whole process cannot be controlled by the ground in real time, so it has to rely on the probe to complete it.
Because there are not so many propellants to offset that high speed, the deceleration depends on the Martian atmosphere when landing on Mars, but the Martian atmosphere is difficult to simulate on the ground.
Overall, Mr Pang said, the way to detect Mars is similar to the way the moon is detected, as well as "round, fall, patrol, back," and finally achieve the goal of manned landing on Mars.
Because Mars is far more distant from Earth than the moon, the exploration of Mars needs to conquer a series of more complex technological difficulties.
Taiwan's "executive director" Lin all announced yesterday morning that "the improper acquisition of property by political parties and their accompanying organizations" has been in effect since today, Taiwan media reported.
"A 100-year-old Nationalist Party, with the commitment and responsibility of society, will not fail to do so," said the Kuomintang vice-president, Mr Jang Kai-yin.
Mr Lam stressed that if a party, an accompanying organization or a trustee violates the provisions of the regulations prohibited by the regulations, the commission shall investigate and punish and punish "according to law."
Mr Lam also announced that the vice-chairman of the party production committee would be appointed by the Deputy Director of the ICAC, Hong Bacon.
He said it was no choice for Mr Gu to serve as the main committee of the improper party production committee, and to borrow Hong Bacon's experience in examining the relevant major cases in the past would serve as the basis for the Commission's inventory of relevant inappropriate party production cases.
As long as there is still party production, no one will give you a social donation, and if the party's production is confiscated, the Nationalists can only ask for social support and sponsorship. "There is no chance of it today."
Mr Jensen also stressed that even if the party's production regulations were not on the road, the Kuomintang party production was not completely confiscated and confiscated, and the rest of the party would donate as promised, allowing the party to return to zero and the party to start with zero.
Original caption: "Corridor doctor" LanYue Feng v. CCTV host Wang Zhian's reputation for infringement of first instance
The Law Evening News was told by CCTV host Wang Zhiian on Sina Weibo's remarks about the "Corridor Doctor" event, and Rangfeng told Wang Zhian and Beijing MicroDreamWorks Network Technology Co. Ltd.
Yesterday afternoon, Haidian Court sentenced the case, ruling that Wang Zhian and the micro-dream company did not constitute a tort, and rejected all the requests for action.
In early 2014, CCTV reporter Wang Zhian investigated that despite sitting in the hospital corridor for more than 600 days, Rangfeng was portrayed by the media as a sad hero of institutional repression, but there was a lot of false information on the reports.
On March 29, 2014, the "Corridor Doctor" show, produced by CCTV News, was broadcast.
There is no evidence to support all kinds of so-called over-medical information reported to the media by Rangfeng.
Wang Zhian, also in the name-certified Weibo, described "Rangfeng to this step as a character, with obvious paranoid personality."
Rangfeng has asked Wang Zhiyan to remove Weibo, apologise to him and compensate for the spiritual damage of 100,000 yuan.
At the time of the court hearing, the two sides talked about whether Wang Zhian violated the reputation of Rangers.
12: 00: Track and field China is very busy with the women's foot rush to break through
The bike is expected to achieve the Olympic gold medal "zero break," and the female foot girl will challenge two world champion Germany, expecting to burst into the top four.
Wang Zhen has been prominent in the last two seasons, winning silver in Beijing Athletic Championships last year, and in May this year the group competed in the world championships to upgrade the individual project title.
According to foreign media, the 27-year-old South Korean archery woman, Zhang Huizhen, won gold in the women's archery individual tournament and won the Olympic gold medal after the group.
Zhang Huizhen, who is thought to be a late-night player who has regretted not getting tickets to the last London Olympics, is now proud to stand on the top podium of the Rio Olympics.
Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal with a total score of 6-2 in the women's archery final in Brazil's Sanba Boulevard Stadium.
She shot for the first time in the fourth grade of primary school until the 27-year-old won the first solo gold medal in the World Cup in 2014 and was a late-star player.
"There was no level before going to middle school to be able to compete in the country," Zhang said.
Zhang Huizhen, who was only fourth in the competition for the London Olympics four years ago, missed the Olympic ticket and only allowed his colleague and friend, Chiu-fu, to take two gold medals.
Zhang Huizhen talked about her gold medal after the women's archery award ceremony, "until the end is to shoot as much as possible, it may be that this brings good results, satisfaction.
The 28-year-old South Korean archery "one sister" and the London Olympic archery individual gold medal winner, Chifu, won the bronze medal.
Chifu, who lost to Zhang Huicheng in the semi-final, began a bronze medal fight with Mexican Olympian Alexander Valencia.
Chiu-fu was able to ensure the bronze medal after the tears in the field, during the silence of the burden of the gold burden.
First, the coaching team has accumulated rich experience in continuous research, followed by scientific training methods, which need to be accumulated over a long period of time.
Archery teams use military training, night through the cemetery and other methods to help the team focus and maintain a common heart.
Although it has not been confirmed, many sources say Apple's 2016 autumn conference will be held in September and the iPhone 7 is really coming.
While Apple has not responded, there has been a flurry of news about the functionality and configuration of the new iPhone, even online with the iPhone 7 "real machine model."
The new generation of iPhones is "a lot of attention," hot, tight, money-free... If you want to buy the goods for the first time, choose a good channel, for example, Suining.
This has exacerbated people's disappointment with the new phones, "it's lengthened, but can't project holographic images at all! This generation of iPhones is bad."
The iPhone 7, like other iPhones, comes with countless secrets before birth.
In addition, multiple sources claimed that the new generation of iPhones would remove 3.5 mm headphones and switch to Bluetooth connection and charging interfaces, which would provide space for Apple to add a second speaker.
Another evidence to support the news is that, as early as 2014, Apple allowed headphones to produce headphones products connected via a charging interface.
The news is true or false, and the answer will not be revealed until Apple's 2016 autumn conference.
But that doesn't prevent industry insiders from looking at the prospect of the iPhone 7-many believe the iPhone 7 will likely become Apple's last big upgrade to the iPhone series.
While the market share of the iPhone has slipped, according to data released recently by the market research agency IDC.
Among them, Goldman maintains a "buy" rating on Apple's shares, while BMO analysts believe the iPhone 7 will reap a historic sales result.
The company's CEO, Hock Tan, also said Apple's future revenue increase would be likely to exceed 20%, thanks entirely to the launch of the iPhone 7.
Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to buy the iPhone 7, compared to just 4 percent of those who planned to buy the iPhone 6 two years ago.
It is understood that 20% of the user groups currently holding the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus are planning to buy the iPhone 7, which is a fairly high proportion.
Second, there is expert analysis that most of the fruit powder likes to replace their own iPhones.
According to statistics, about 26% of all iPhone users have not replaced their phones for two years, that is, nearly 120 million users have been using the iPhone for two years.
"There were several earthquakes in Taiwan during the iPhone 7 production," the media said, adding that "the level of damage to the production facilities is beyond imagination and is likely to have an impact on the initial iPhone 7 supply."
The contradiction between supply and demand can affect the average user, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time low price start the iPhone 7.
According to people familiar with the matter, Mr Suining has seen frequent meetings with Apple in the near future to prepare for adequate supplies.
Operators have agreed with Suining, and predictably, with the depth of cooperation between the two sides, it is bound to bring lower prices and more intimate services to users.
"At the lowest price, consumers might be able to buy the iPhone 7 for just seven yuan a day."
Ample supply and a variety of preferences, allowing the purchase of the iPhone 7 no longer "pressure mountain," and Su Ning's logistics, it will turn this beautiful into a more intuitive sense of experience.
Maybe, you'll get a call in the middle of the night, "Hello, Suining Yi, your iPhone 7 has arrived."
The organizers hope that through the exhibition, the local people will learn more about the long history of Chinese culture so as to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.
Barcelona's "Ming Dynasty Cultural Show" is part of the European tour, which will continue until early October.
The Bank of China and the Bank of China released the 2016 semi-annual report yesterday, and in the second quarter, Kim renewed his shares.
Among them, the Chinese bank held 2929.31 million shares in China, and by the end of June, the number of Chinese bank shares in China had increased to 388.7 million shares, and the proportion of its shares increased from 3.35% to 3.62%.
In addition, in the second quarter, the shares increased to nearly 600 million shares, and accounted for 2.77% of the shares of PDB.
Recently, the lotus flower garden of Lifu Village in Tongxiang City, Zhejiang Province, is officially open to villagers and tourists.
The park consists of more than 100 circular small pond ponds, planting about 300 varieties of ornamental lotus, lily and so on.
The rural lotus industry has both ornamental, leisure and economic benefits, becoming a bright spot in the development of new rural areas.
According to foreign media, the Rio Olympics "Green Pool" event has attracted much attention recently because the pool water has changed from blue to green.
On the morning of the 10th morning, however, the water polo pool adjacent to the diving pool also turned green.
The Australian water polo player said after the match that his eyes were stinging, trying to shed tears.
Previously, Rio Olympic officials confirmed that the water was green, and said the water discoloration was due to alkaline weakness and would not affect the physical health of athletes.
But Australian athletes, after winning a match with the Japanese team at the water polo pool, said the eye was tingling.
As soon as the pool water became green, the organizers worked overtime on 9 night to deal with the diving pool, but the color of the water polo pool was also quickly changed on the morning of 10.
The environmental conditions in the water polo pool gradually deteriorated during the Australian team's match with the Japanese team, but officials stressed they would return the water quality of the two pools to their original color on 11 November.
"The level of salinity in the diving pool was first weakened yesterday afternoon," said Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the Rio Olympics.
"We learned about a series of causes that could trigger the discoloration of the pool and the alkalinity of the water quality."
Water sports centres have carried out a series of tests on water quality, with hundreds of divers and swimmers using the pool to determine water quality conditions to meet the standards.
"We've been going through normal procedures these days, but we may have overlooked the fact that the more athletes are likely to have an impact on water quality," he said.
"But changes in water color will certainly have no impact on physical health, especially for athletes."
"This independent team confirmed our assessment, as well as the measures we have taken to restore the pool to normal color and normal chemistry."
"We had hoped the pool would return to normal color in the morning, but the pace of recovery was affected by the rain."
According to Taiwan's Central Society, an explosion last night in a prison in the northern suburbs of the Greater Manila area caused the governor to be injured and 10 prisoners died, reportedly including two Chinese.
ABC-CBN TV reported the incident took place at Paranaque prison around 9 p.m. last night, but police did not make preliminary claims until 2 a.m. today.
Police said the 10 prisoners asked to see the warden and complained about the supervisors, but the two sides did not speculate, with prisoners throwing grenades and causing explosions.
The prison has yet to release the names of the dead prisoners, but GMA TV reported that it included two Chinese.
As of 8 a.m. the prison had not yet made a detailed statement, including how the prisoner had obtained a grenade.
Yesterday, police in central Philippines entered the district prison in Leyte province, killing one criminal who was "attempting to attack the police."
Urumqi standardize the travel agent market business order travel agency must sign the contract with the tourists
At present, Xinjiang has entered the tourist season, and in order to standardize the business order of the tourist market, the law enforcement detachment of the city's tourism law enforcement branch of Urumqi has yesterday dealt with the non-specification of tourism vehicles in the market and the low contract rate between travel agencies and tourists.
At eight o'clock yesterday morning, around 10 large-scale buses filled with tourists were parked around the Kelbinski Hotel, most of which were on a day-to-day tour of the Tianchi.
"Hello, I'm Urumqi City Tourist Office. Have you signed a contract with this travel agent?"
Yu Bin, a staff member of the law enforcement department of Urumqi City Bureau of Transport, said: "There are also class-line cars running tourist passenger projects in Urumqi market and no qualifications."
"There is a fine of three to 100,000 penalties for this penalty, and the driver is not entitled to a fine of 2,000 yuan."
It is understood that the city of Urumqi's tourism law enforcement department has already inspected the places where tourists are concentrated in West Park and Red Mountain.
"The first is safety, the second is the norm, the travel vehicle has no small things, and once the problem is a group injury," said Ma Qi, deputy head of the tourism law enforcement detachment of Urumqi City.
"We continue to inspect the market and regulate the travel of travel agents to ensure the safety of tourists."
On the morning of August 12, the State Department News Office held a press conference on the state of the national economy in July 2016.
A spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics and director of the National Economic Integration Statistics Division said that in July, some indicators of the national economy slowed but were still operating in a reasonable range.
Data released by the Office for National Statistics showed that data on fixed asset investment growth and total imports fell back in July.
Mr Sheng said that with regard to the operation of the national economy in July, I would like to borrow a phrase that the Prime Minister once said was "volatile and still good," which could provide a better overview of the characteristics of the economic operation in July.
He explained that "shape fluctuation" means that the growth of some economic indicators in July was indeed a fall.
Because the domestic and foreign economies are still in deep adjustment in July, the international situation is complex and changeable, and the recovery of the world economy is less than expected, so the export pressure is still relatively large.
From the domestic point of view, the whole economy is still at a critical stage of adjustment, the pain of adjustment is released and the economy is under little downward pressure, so some indicators are somewhat volatile.
Mr Sheng pointed out that there was also a special situation in July, when floods were more severe, and the heat and heat of the heat had some impact on production operations in some areas.
According to a recent release by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people across the country were affected and direct economic losses exceeded 200 billion yuan.
In terms of industry, investment and transport-related indicators, these areas are affected in varying degrees.
The increase in cargo turnover in July was 3.6 percentage points lower than last month, and floods have had a certain impact on traffic in these areas.
From these factors, the volatility of some of the indicators in July is also normal and expected.
He said the "trend is still good" means that despite the slowdown in economic growth, the overall stability of the economy is steady, steady and steady.
The CPI rose 1.8% in July, the ring rose 0.2%; the CPI rose 2.1% in January-July, so the price situation was generally stable.
According to Chongqing Meteorological Bureau portal network to each district county high temperature weather statistics, except Youyang, the rest of our city can receive a different degree of high temperature allowance.
At present, at least 28 provinces across the country have defined the criteria for the granting of allowances, although the standards are not the same in the provinces and municipalities, while Chongqing receives a high temperature allowance in the form of a high-temperature working day allowance.
No less than 37 degrees per person shall be issued at a rate of not less than $10 per person per day; those above 37 degrees shall be issued at no less than $15 per person per day.
A maximum of 20 yuan / day allowance per month for high-temperature staff (with the exception of workers who have enjoyed a high-temperature job allowance in accordance with the law).
According to this standard, open states with the largest number of days of hot weather last month were able to get 330 yuan and the lowest number of days were 80 yuan, while the highest temperature in Youyang did not meet high temperature standards, so there was no high temperature allowance.
In the past, many units will rush to the high temperature allowance with cool drinks, and the city safety bureau says the practice is not in accordance with the current method.
The employing unit shall not deduct or reduce the wages of labourers due to the cessation of work and shorter working hours due to high temperature weather.
The Bureau of Municipal Services said that employees who encounter high-temperature operations without a high temperature allowance may seek legal rights and interests through the labour dispute mediation agency where the enterprise is located, or call 12333 complaints.
If the employing unit refuses to issue a high temperature allowance, the laborer may complain to the competent department of human resources social security at or above the county level.
At the same time, because the high temperature allowance is part of the salary, not the benefit, it should be included in the total salary and deduction of the tax.
Therefore, the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage and must be issued in cash and not in kind, such as drinks.

That said, all moving cars and 30 pairs of trains can be stopped at Urumqi station.
Now both stations can buy tickets, the train passes between them for about 10 minutes, and passengers need to pay attention to the specific station name of the terminal and terminal.
The formal input and operation of the new passenger station in Urumqi will become an important platform for Xinjiang to build a national integrated transportation city and promote the "Silk Road Economic Belt" and the construction of the New Area.
Gracia is a budding female giant, with the smell of rainforests.
In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the giant mouth bird Gracia and its story have long been household names.
At a news conference on August 10, Gracia, who recovered after surgery, finally appeared to show people his brand-new 3D print plastic beak.
The giant beak, which was broken up a year and a half ago, has finally regained its new life.
Not only did the day announce that it was 100% back to health, it was the day when it moved into a luxury birdhouse and met with human friends who cared about it.
Gracia, who entered the new home, was slightly shy, but not many times became lively, rolling in the basin, eating grapes with a new beak.
To remind people of the damage it once suffered, technicians did not color its new beak, but retained the original white of 3D print material.
The bird beak is a thin layer of keratin sheath, hollow inside, only a few thin bone support rods crisscross.
Although there is this internal reinforcement, the beak of a giant beak is fragile and broken when it is hurt.
Animal rescue centers, taxonomists and an American 3D printing company have worked together to produce several "test beaks" for Gracia, finally creating a "perfect beak" that suits it best.
Now Gracia has been able to use a new beak to drink water, eat, and even peck small grains.
"The design of the final finished product took about two months, and it took only four or five hours to print out."
"3D printing is not the technology of the future, it's actually gone into your life," said Thomas Longger, chairman of the US SGD printing company, in an interview with Xinhua International.
In January 2015, in a farm in Gracia, Allahu province, central Costa Rica, Gracia, a bloody giant, was discovered.
At the time, its beak was brutally broken by a gang of young people, it was completely unable to eat, life was dying.
As a result of the media reports, Gracia has caused a wave of anti-abuse calls in and out of Costa Rica.
There are calls for tougher animal protection laws and greater penalties for abusers.
People come forward spontaneously and do their best to help Gracia recover as much as possible before the injury.
Even 3D printing technology inventor Chuck Hull was involved in the design of Gracia's beak.
"The situation in Gracia is special, and its upper beak is less than 1 cm, so it brings a lot of difficulties to the installation of the new beak."
"We scan Gracia first and then design and make an extended prosthesis that is slightly longer than the rest of its beak, and glue it to its upper beak."
"This can reduce further invasive injuries to Gracia," Long told Xinhua International.
Before installing the prosthesis, staff clean up the beak for Gracia every day to prevent infection.
Thousands of miles away, the story of the giant mouth, Gracia, moved the famous documentary director, Paula Eredia, and Discovery News Channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded the details of Gracia's installation of the new beak, recording a documentary "The State of the Big Bird," which was broadcast on the Animal Planet Channel this month.
The documentary "The State of the Big Bird" shows people how a tiny giant bird can make a country change and how to get its nationals involved in the fight against abuse.
Core tip: Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of China's small independent refineries known as "teapot."
Japan's biggest oil company, JX Energy, believes that "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the downturn," Japan's largest oil company, JX Energy, said on August 12.
Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of China's small independent refinery, known as the "teapot."
The quality of China's petroleum products is getting closer to Japan's oil products as a result of the Chinese government's strengthened environmental regulations.
Before obtaining the import license for crude oil, the "teapot refinery" generally imports heavy oil with higher sulphur content from places such as Russia.
The production of petroleum products with higher sulfur content and poor oil production has become one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining permission for the import of crude oil, the "teapot refinery" was able to import Oman crude oil and Russian crude oil with lower sulphur content, as well as the quality of its oil products.
"As China's domestic oil product quality standards continue to improve, the capacity of refining equipment has also risen," said Tung-burn General Oil.
As a result, the quality of the oil products exported by China has gradually reached the same level as that of Japan (the world's highest quality).
"After the end of 2015, China started exporting high-quality light oil to Australia" and competing with Japanese products in the Asian market, JX Energy said.
While "Japan's high oil" is facing a crisis, Japan's oil companies are responding only to "paying attention to the market and exporting to profitable areas."
Due to the huge impact of China's export of petroleum products on the market in Asia, the attention to the teapot refineries is also increasing.

The Bureau of Statistics said New Zealand's population growth had previously been more than 2% at the peak of the "baby boom" population in 1974 and the early 1950s to the early 1960s.
As of June this year, New Zealand's net inflow of migrants in 12 months was 691,000, becoming the main driver of New Zealand's population growth in recent years.
In addition, in the same time period, the natural increase in New Zealand's population was 2.82 million.
New Zealand has an average annual net inflow of 2.18 million people in the last 10 years, with an average annual population growth of 3.23 million, according to the data.
In terms of demographics, a large influx of migrants means a gradual expansion of the proportion of "working-age population" aged 15 to 39.
In the 12 months to June 2016, New Zealand's working-age population grew 3.6% to 1.58 million.
At the same time, the ageing population over the age of 65 has increased by 3.6% to 700,000.

Ultraviolet rays not only make students skin black, more sunburn skin, how to allow skin to smooth through military training, not sunburn?
Sunscreen packaging is usually marked with SPF and PA, SPF is a sunscreen index, is aimed at UVB UV, our common SPF index is 15, 30, 50, etc.
The products marked with PA are aimed at UVA so that sunscreen can play a more effective role, usually when the intensity of PA is expressed by +, with more than one + indicating that effective protection time is extended.
Oily skin should choose the water-borne sunscreen with strong permeability, and sunscreen spray is also a good choice.
Dry skin should choose frost-like sunscreen; neutral skin is not strictly prescribed, sensitive skin to wipe any maintenance is a burden, it is recommended to choose pure and rational sun protection products.
Remember to apply sunscreen half an hour earlier, because sunscreen will take time to fully penetrate the skin.
Military training sun time longer, sunscreen wipe every two hours to have a lasting effect, never be lazy.
Because the skin has just been stimulated by the sun, military training should not immediately use whitening products.
After the military training, if conditions can be wrapped with a towel wrapped in ice to cool the burned skin to slow the local heat.
Farmers who buy agricultural machinery during the exhibition continue to implement the cumulative subsidy policy, and farmers buy agricultural machinery with a maximum of 40% subsidy.
This exhibition is aimed at global recruiting, especially the invitation to the countries and target market countries along the "One Belt One Road."
This exhibition aims to complete 60 of the signing projects, the introduction of $22 billion, and the signing of more than 160 trade contracts with a contract value of 3.2 billion yuan.
It is reported that the "Xiang Fair" has been settled for seven consecutive years, due to the strong foundation of the manufacturing industry in Loudi City, Hunan Province, and the long history of industrial development.
As the host of the "Xiang Fair," Loudi has established trade relations with more than 90 countries around the world.
"Xiang Fair" became an important platform for the local cultivation of characteristic industries and the promotion of characteristic industries out of the country.
On some nights, the ionosphere is full of free electrons, which means that radio signals can go further.
The U.S. Air Force is interested in replicating the effect, according to the American Journal of Mass Science on August 11.
While the ionosphere, which has a steady mass of free electrons, can help people tune in on the edge of the broadcast range of a university radio station, it may not be the interest of the US Air Force.
The electron-filled ionosphere means that the radio used by the military has a larger broadcast range, and it may provide some protection for GPS signals from solar storms.
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of cube satellites based on demand, which can strengthen the ionosphere when needed.
But first, these teams that contract with the Air Force must prove that the relevant scientific principles will work.
Industry figures show a total coal capacity of nearly 6 billion tons in 2015, with an excess of 1.8 billion tons of coal capacity across the country.
Over the past decade, the State Council has issued five notifications of the elimination of excess and backward capacity.
While the first four times did not target the coal industry, the target industry has a direct relationship with the coal industry.
Between November and January this year, 5,500 power coal prices in Qinhuangdao were hovering at 370 yuan / ton low, and 90 percent of coal companies fell into losses.
Coal prices have picked up gradually since February, with the recent rise in power coal prices in Qinhuangdao, rising to a 16-month high, climbing to 436 yuan per ton, up nearly 70 yuan from the beginning of the year.
As the price picks up, all walks of life worry about it: Will a batch of small coal mines resume production?
In response, the economic director of China (Hainan) Institute of Reform and Development has conducted analysis and interpretation.
Kun-ming: Going to capacity has attracted high attention from all sides, and today's report on the coal industry's ability to go to capacity has also made everyone feel more worried.
The three surface factors still reflect the relative lag in our way of growth in the past, which is that the government-led growth approach has not yet been fundamentally transformed.
Second, it is also directly related to the push of local government, and in the process of capacity-building, the funds and corresponding supporting measures are in place, and from this point of view, the differences in different regions are indeed larger.
Third, if some of the provinces that are currently slow to make progress in the second half, they are likely to be at greater risk.
In this case, relying on central prize money to advance the process of capacity-building may have a certain negative impact.
First of all, going to capacity is not a simple exercise of total control.
Our aim is to reconstruct the new industry in the whole coal industry by eliminating the backward capacity, advancing the optimization of the structure.
In the process of deploying to capacity, local governments must combine the transformation and upgrading of production capacity and coal industry to vigorously develop related services.
Second, to complete this year's capacity-building mission this year, we need to give full play to the power of administrative supervision and administrative supervision.
Finally, we should strengthen the bottom-up role of social security.
Because the market is directly related to employment, we need to strengthen employment skills training for staff and staff.
"The decline in ranking is due to the deterioration of foreign investment in Brazil's GDP development in the medium term."
In 2015, Brazil's participation in global direct investment was 3.7 percent, down from 5.7 percent in 2014.
Credit Suisse's International Investment Attraction Index includes four sub-indexes: Infrastructure, economic outlook, business environment and direct investment.
In 2015, international direct investment in Brazil was $64.6 billion, down from $73.1 billion in 2014.

Original caption: Canadian police killed IS supporters: Home-made bomb attacks in downtown preparation work close to end
The taxi company said the taxi was scheduled to go to Derry's home before police arrived.
In a news conference Wednesday, Canadian police said the information received by police included a "martyrdom video" provided by the FBI about the young man's imminent attack.
In the video, a man wearing a black Ballack Rafa hat is reading the Koran, referring to crimes against Muslims, and vowed to launch an attack on a Canadian city soon, according to the German voice.
He said in the video that the attack would take place within 72 hours and was at rush hour.

After the upgrading of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal feeder channel, the old Wanfu River and the North Grand Slam channel collect tolls on September 1.
These two tributary channels adopt the social financing way to reform and construction, the fees have been approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government.
The old Wanfu River channel flows through Jinxiang, fish platform, through Nanyang Lake into the main channel of the Grand Canal, 32.5 km.
According to the requirements of navigation, the old Wanfu River waterway adopts the way of conservation and transformation, the local depth is deep, the local sharp bend is straightened, and the navigation conditions are improved.
The channel flows through Jinxiang County, Ren City, through Nanyang Lake into the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, 19 km long.
The renovation of the two channels began construction in February 2011, with the completion of cross-examination and acceptance in January 2015, and the main body of investment construction and operation was the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center in Jining City.
In accordance with the principle of "loan construction and fee repayment," the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center in Jining City collects channel tolls according to the fee standards approved by the price bureau of Shandong Province.
Of these, basic tolls are collected at 1.75 yuan / load ton, and mileage tolls are collected at 0.05 yuan / km load ton.
Tolls are collected from June 15, 2016 to June 14, 2019.
The reporter from Jining City Hong Kong Airways Bureau understands that at present, there are four toll lanes in Jiining, respectively, the water river channel, the white horse river channel, the north big slip channel, the old Wanfu River waterway.
The four channels are the tributary channel of the Grand Canal in Beijing.
Su Shui River waterway upgrading project is the first to adopt the "government + market" model for the construction of inland river port infrastructure construction in Shandong Province, the government accounts for the main investment and the social capital supplementary funding gap.
The BaiMa River, the Old Wanfu River, the BeiJing River and other feeder lanes take the form of pure market operation.
The funds allocated by the state cannot meet the needs of construction and restrict the progress of the waterway upgrade.
Social funds for the construction of public infrastructure meet the requirements of the state policy, and also become the way to crack the bottleneck of funds.
Ning Zao's performance in the 100-meter freestyle semi-final has made many Chinese viewers speechless.
But in the 50m freestyle pre-season, Yongzao once again refreshed people's "bottom line."
In fact, the 50m freestyle is not Ning Zao, his performance and best performance at the Kazan World Championships has also determined that he is unlikely to make a breakthrough in the project.
Sure enough, the Great Gazette of Hong Kong's authoritative media revealed that the biggest reason for the defeat was that he had lost interest in swimming.
Many of the factors on the sidelines may have had a big impact on his thinking about the future, and he is now likely to be more interested in going into the entertainment circle.
After Kazan World Championships, Ning Zao, with its ultra-high value and good grades, instantly became net red.
As a result, "national husband," "small fresh meat," "figure beauty male" and other names also constantly become the label of him.
A variety of commercial activities to find the door, the good money path, become a golden light flashing road.
In this case, Ning Tao, even choosing to retire at this time to join the entertainment circle, is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly viable path.
After all, he was only 23 years old and, after a certain study, was able to play one or two TV plays with his breath.
But Ning Zao needs to see that, compared with these predecessors, do they have enough qualifications?
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Liu Xuan, 21, has come to the end of the athlete's career.
Liu Xuan's beautiful appearance allowed her to be remembered quickly and laid the foundation for her future march into the entertainment circle.
After retiring, Liu made a number of TV plays and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tian Liang participated in the two Olympic Games in the single-double ten-meter race, and won 2 gold 2 silver.
But after losing to teammate Hu Jia in the 2004 Olympic Games single-ten-meter race, Tian Liang's competitive state fell and was fired from the diving team.
And the fact that he and his daughter took part in a variety show, such as "Dad Go," made him make his eye.
Once gymnastic gold a generation Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and Chen Yi ice all high-profile participation in a variety of variety shows.
It is worth noting that Yang Wei Li Xiaopeng led China to the 2008 Olympic men's championship, Yang Wei more than twice the individual all-round gold medal, known as the Almighty Wang.
Chen Yi-ice, while leading China to the 2012 Olympic group champion, also became the king of the ring.
And after a miscalculation of the gold medal at the London Olympics, Chen's magnanimous move has also allowed him to circle the powder countless times.
But the main energy of these athletes is still in the field, and the show is just as easy to touch.
But whether retired or active athletes, to be able to get the favor of the entertainment circle needs to have the achievements to be guaranteed.
After all, athletes step into a new field, whether it is the ability or the human pulse, is a blank state.
Even if Tian Liang, Liu Xuan so mixed entertainment circles for years "old people," ordinary viewers mentioned them, more thought of their performance at the Olympics.
And Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and other new people, in the presentation of the comprehensive show, without exception is "Olympic champion."
Compared to the above-mentioned people, Ning Zao's title of a swimming world championship is still slightly thin.
What's more, compared to Tian Liang, Liu Xuan, Yang Wei and other people's achievements, Ning Zao in the 23-year-old, a slight setback in the sports career, the negative impact on its image is probably immeasurable.
After all, when it comes to athletes, people's demands are "not to win a hundred wins, but to be fearless," Ning Zao is far from this point.
Ten thousand steps to say, Ning Zao is handsome, can rely on Yan value to obtain the support of thousands of brain residual powder.
Not a bit of power, only by appearance, want to mix well in the entertainment circle, this difficulty is not better than good training to retrieve the proper state.
The way of life is based on individual will, but how to choose, Ning Zao should have a number.
On the surface, the network social platform expands the circle of communication and reduces the sense of loneliness.
Network social sphere of influence is more and more widespread, not only gradually replaced traditional telephone contact, even infiltration into the offline real life circle, quietly change the social life of the people.
The benefits of social networking are obvious, such as convenience and convenience, so it is particularly easy to be favored by young ethnic groups.

"Social network has the characteristics of low cost, fast transmission speed, many people communicate at the same time, meet the needs of contemporary college students."
Expanding the circle of relationships, more equal dialogue, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we love to chat more and more.
New entrants to the company love to communicate with their colleagues, "because they are not very familiar with each other, and through the social platform's praise, the relationship is much closer than before."
Friends and friends also used to communicate on the line, "before friends because of some misunderstanding for some time not contact, later in a large group of conversation a few words to warm up."
IT engineer Wu Yan is a deep network social enthusiast, most of his social life is on the line, and network contacts are more than the number of friends on the line.
Wu said himself to be more "like fish water" on the internet.
"You can reply to your friends at your own convenience, because there is a lot of time to speak, and the expression can be clearer."
"You are hiding under the ID to avoid a face-to-face collision, not only to have room for manoeuvre, but even to give each other more time and space to think about words and deeds."
"People of different identities have the right and efficiency to speak the same way, social concerns in real life seem to be eliminated in cyberspace."
Wu Yan's friend Xiao Peng, however, felt that Wu said in life is a "boring house man."
Xiao Peng and Wu spoke in a large crowd, because both were active speakers and soon became familiar.
Xiao Peng feels that Wu and the network are different, speech boring, also does not take the initiative to make an opinion, turning over and over is a few words "ha, good, yes," or "this I want to check on the Internet."

On August 11, when a reporter's phone interview had returned to Huang Yilin in Mianyang, Sichuan, she said: "The situation was so urgent that there was only one thought in my mind to save people!"
Huang Yilin is a student at the 2015 level of the College of Landscape Landscape in Central and South China.

Just not far away, suddenly saw a group of people shouting, out of curiosity to go up.
"The little boy was out of sight, the little girl struggled desperately in the water, only her little head was revealed on the river, and she sank down from time to time, and Huang Yilin, who had learned to swim when she was a child, hurried off to save people.
After the launch, Huang Yilin, 165 cm tall, found that she couldn't step on it!
Before it looked calm water, underneath is a torrent!
But she was desperate to swim to the little girl.
Huang Yilin said the river water was muddy, turbulent, less than five meters away, almost spent all her strength.
She tried her best to push the little girl to the edge of the river, "the slope was particularly slippery, and I was afraid I had no strength to sink."
So, Huang Yilin asked her mother for help, heard her daughter's call for help, the water-poor Ms. Yin prepared to launch the rescue, was stopped by the next visitor.
On August 10, when Huang Yilin jumped the river to save people, Ms. Yin received a lot of friends and relatives sympathy and praise, and also received a lot of friends and relatives "accountability."
"It's really scary to think back now! To be honest, my heart is broken when the child can't stand on the river bank and ask me for help."
Ms Yin said with dismay that, despite the danger, she would still support her daughter's choice if she was in that scene again, and she was proud of her daughter!
As a result of being forced, Huang Yilin rarely took the initiative after learning to swim, "I didn't think the skill came in handy."
According to Mr Chen, the monitor of Huang Yilin class, Huang Yilin is a recognized "school bully" in the class, and is helpful.

Mass fraud text messages reach a certain amount, even if not fraud successful, can also be guilty of fraud.
The People's Court of Wolong District, Nanyang City, Henan Province, tried to find out that, from September 30 to October 4, 2015, the defendant, Li Jiwang, used pseudo-base station equipment to send fraudulent information in Tongbai County and Nanyang City District.

The North East tiger is currently listed as an endangered (EN) species by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List of Endangered Species.
According to the forestry department in Jilin Province, the data from joint monitoring by China and Russia in 1998 showed that there were only four to six wild northeast tigers in Jilin province and three to five in the Northeast.
The protection of wildlife in Jilin province has been increasing in recent years, and the population of Dongbei tiger and Northeast Panther in China is growing significantly, and the distribution area has been expanding.
The latest monitoring data for 2015 showed that in Jilin Province alone, 27 of the wild northeast tigers and 42 of the Northeast Panthers were monitored.
As the world wildlife conservation flagship species distributed in the Sino-Russian border region, the cooperation between China and Russia is of great significance to the recovery and reproduction of the wild northeast tiger and leopard.
According to Jilin Forestry Bureau, Jilin Province has established a long-term stable cooperation exchange mechanism with Russia.
At the end of the 11-year 2016 China Hunchun Tiger Leopard Protection International Forum, China and Russia, the forestry sector and animal protection organizations have reached a number of consensus again.
Jilin Forestry Bureau said the strengthening of China-Russia tiger and leopard protection cooperation is not only a very urgent task for the protection of the tiger and leopard in China, but also the urgent task of maintaining the health of the Russian tiger and leopard population.
As a leading cadre of Party members, Sun Fu Jian lost his ideal belief and seriously violated the discipline of the Party, and the party's 18-year-old is still not convergent, uncollected and disciplined, with poor nature and serious circumstances.
After this case, after multiple media reports, became the focus case, the social impact is extremely bad.
After the case, Haikou City Public Security Bureau Interpol detachment leader attaches great importance to the immediate organization of a team of lean police forces to launch the investigation.
Police immediately ran the suspect on the Internet, took various measures to control it, and contacted the field police to investigate the whereabouts of the kingdom.
Because the suspect is a repeat offender, has been repeatedly dealt with by the public security organs, has a strong anti-reconnaissance capability, coupled with his long-term drug use, interrogation of poisoning addiction often, interrogation work is very difficult.
The Greenlandic shark, also known as the small head sleeping shark, is widely distributed in the North Atlantic waters around Greenland and Iceland, where it reaches 4 to 5 metres in adulthood.
But they grow extremely slowly, sometimes only about 1 cm a year, suggesting that the Greenland shark may have an extra long life.
Traditional methods of measurement usually use animal calcification tissue, which can be used in some sharks, but the calcification tissue is very sparse in Greenland sharks.
The new study, led by Ulyus Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, turned to the eye lens of the Greenlandic shark for a radioactive carbon test year.
The method had previously been used to determine the age of whales, but it was the first time to determine the age of fish such as sharks.
Their analysis showed that the biggest shark life was estimated at 392, with an error of 120.
That's to say, the shark is at least 272 years old and most likely to reach 512.
In addition, female Greenland sharks are said to be sexually mature when they are about 4 meters long, and are converted to age at least until 156 years old.
The researchers therefore wrote in the paper that Greenland sharks are known, the longest-lived vertebrates on Earth, more than the previous long-lived champion of the whale (211).
Over the past year, the exchange rate has been remarkable, the RMB exchange rate has remained basically stable, and it has laid the foundation for promoting the internationalization of the yuan.
From the market performance, in a year, the exchange rate of the RMB exchange rate is obvious, the exchange rate elasticity is increased and the exchange rate is expected to be stable overall.
To date, the RMB against the dollar in the middle price of the upper and lower ups and downs, but the process rise and fall alternately.
Last year's "8: 11" change was implemented in 2005, with a significant appreciation of the yuan against the dollar over the decade.
Since the introduction of the new exchange, the renminbi has changed its previous appreciation, with a year-on-year devaluation of the RMB exchange rate of about 8%.
On October 1 this year, the International Monetary Fund will formally accept the renminbi as the SDR (special drawing rights) weight currency.
This week, statistics released by the China Customs Administration show that China's imports and exports totaled 13.21 trillion yuan in the first seven months of the year, down 3 percent from the same period last year.
In July, the total value of China's imports and exports fell by just 0.9%, especially exports, which rose 2.9% year-on-year.
Experts believe that despite signs of stabilising imports and exports in July, there should be no high expectations.
In July, China's imports and exports totaled 2.09 trillion yuan, a decline of 0.9 percent.
Among them, exports of 1.22 trillion yuan, an increase of 2.9%; imports of 873 billion yuan, down 5.7%; a trade surplus of 342.8 billion yuan, an increase of 34%.
Although the total value of imports and exports continued to decline year-on-year, export data grew, which is also the fifth consecutive month of growth in exports since March.

In late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will travel to Kenya to attend the sixth African Development Conference, according to China's Voice of Newsnight.
The African Development Conference was dominated by Japan, and the previous five meetings were held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, so the meeting will also be the first to shift Africa.
Japanese foreign ministry officials said the meeting on the ground in Africa helped raise concerns among African and European countries about Japan.
In response to Abe's visit, Kyodo News said the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party would send a group of experts to the countries concerned.
It is no coincidence that Japan's "inbound" path began in the early 1990s, and the African Development Conference, launched by Japan, began in 1993.
Africa, which has 53 seats in the United Nations, is an important ticket for the United Nations, and how will Japan abandon Africa if it wants to "go into it"?
An exchange of views will also be held with interested parties on the extremist organization "Islamic State" and terrorist activities.
The "Western Group" will visit seven countries such as Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau.
Japanese Foreign Minister Yasuo Fukuda also recently stated his intent on the African Development Conference at the UN Security Council.
Abe has announced here that, for the stability of sub-Saharan Africa, it will provide 1,000 billion yen (about 6.1 billion yuan) in aid over five years.
Observers generally believe that Japan's generosity to Africa has been largely twofold: One is to increase Japan's sense of presence in Africa; and the other is to win support from African countries on the issue of entry.
"From a political point of view, Africa, while relatively underdeveloped, has a relatively large number of countries, so Japan has always regarded it as the so-called" big ticket field, "said Yang Berjiang, a Japanese expert.
Japan will not give up in the future, and jobs for Africa will not be terminated and will be strengthened.
Economic aspects, because Japan's production capacity is relatively strong, but the domestic market is relatively limited, especially in the background of young children aging, domestic demand is relatively depressed.
However, from 10 years ago, Junichiro Koizumi, 10 years later, Abe, during which Japan has repeatedly launched the "sprint," has failed.
Yang Berjiang, a Japanese expert, believes that Japan's usual intentions are clear, but the road to entry is bound to be difficult.
Japan wants to achieve its own goals, first and foremost with neighboring countries, in which Japan needs to have a correct attitude, whether in geopolitics or in national disputes and historical awareness.

Traditional custom introduces the opening of the new bright spot "2016 Yuelan Cultural Festival" Hong Kong Wetland Park
The music, the traditional little food, the fancy decoration, the crowd's turbulent scene.
The "2016 Yuelan Cultural Festival," hosted by the Hong Kong Federation of Hong Kong Societies, was held at Victoria Park from 12 to 14 April, the largest in Hong Kong.
In addition to the continuation of the existing "robin competition," also increased the family can participate in the "parent basin for the pile base race."
Not only introduces the history of Yueland culture in the form of comics, but also has the theme 3D self-photographing area, traditional small food area and traditional craft mobile classroom, which attracts a lot of children and overseas people to experience the visit.
A couple of couples from France have spent nearly three hours at the scene of the event and have experienced it in the mini-flower mobile classroom.
"Find this special holiday online, so it's fresh to decide to come and see it," he said.
They say that while France has a holiday similar to that of its ancestors, the atmosphere is heavy, unlike here, with music, food and traditional crafts.
"In such a busy financial metropolis in Hong Kong, it is also possible to see such a large, organized ritual of worship of ancestors," she said.
"This not only reflects the diversity of Chinese culture, but also allows more people to understand these traditional crafts and carry on."

The enthusiasm of the Mexican audience impressed the white lady and the young actor.

Liu's visit to Sanya to investigate "double-repair and double-city" requirements to raise the level of urban construction
On the morning of the 12th morning, Liu gave a seminar and listened to the report on the progress of the pilot work on the "Twin Cities" in the city of Sanya and the suggestions of the various departments concerned.
Liu gives full recognition to the achievements of the pilot work and the good experiences and good practices that have been created.
Mr Lau stressed that Sanya should seize the opportunity of historical development and take the "double-fix" "double city" pilot work as an important grasp and give full play to the leading role in the development of economic and social development throughout the province.
To promote international tourism island international level to play a good lead role, from the details of the details, enrich the international elements, create international boutique.
We should play a leading role in urban and rural integration and all-round tourism, accelerate the construction of special-style towns, integrate tourism elements into every project, and build every village and town in Sanya into a tourist area.
We should play a leading role in "service social investment 100 days" action, promote a number of major projects and park construction, ensure the landing of high quality projects, and implement the requirements of the big action.
Provincial Committee Standing Committee, Sanya City Committee Secretary Zhang Qi, Vice Governor Wang Lu, the provincial government secretary, Lu Zhiyuan participated in the research and discussion.
Deng Yaping, who took 18 world titles in his 14-year campaign career, became the first person to win four Olympic gold medals in China's Olympic history.
She kept the world first in the table tennis table for eight years and was the longest-running female athlete in the history of table tennis.
On September 26, 2010, he was the Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Daily newspaper and General Manager of the People's Search Network Co. Ltd.
A few days ago, she will work with Miss Yue Minhong to create a new entrepreneurial platform for the first sports industry in China.
The Chinese body also has such a group of star coaches: They are infinite in the time of the athletes and have won countless glory for the country; after retirement, they will learn to learn from the newcomers and cultivate the Chinese champions.
As the first world champion for Chinese men's gymnastics, Huang Yubin chose to pick up the whip after retiring.
From the women's team coach to the male team coach, to the general coach, Huang Yubin has built an "Olympic gold regiment," and the team has won nine gold 1 silver 4 copper in the Beijing Olympic Games.
Since then, Tian Liang has always been advertising endorsements, more in recent years played the "bullpen" and "Lei Feng" and other important roles.
A lot of NBA players have proved their strength, but there has been a decline in progress.
Whether it's because of age increases or when appearances are limited, there are a number of players showing a setback every season.
Of course, some "retrogression" may be just the shrinkage of the data, and the strength of these players may not have fallen.
Even if Wade is still one of the best scorers in the league, his performance in the bull should not be so good.
He and Rondo's backfield range is limited, with home star Butler's three-point hit rate of only 32.8%, which allows them to hit the offensive next season.
Coming to the wind city, the Lightning Man is bound to give the ball more to Butler and Rondo, who is likely to choose a healthy play in the regular season.
Okaford's situation was more awkward, as the first choice of the 76 people last season, he had to compete with Simmons and Enbide for time and ball rights in the new season.
The competition may not come soon, Simmons needs to adapt to the NBA, and Enbide will have to fully recover from the injury as soon as possible, but it is still a matter of whether Okafort could have a place in the 76-man PFDJ.
Last season, Okford's 32% score came from low-level offense, which was higher than Cossins, Vujacic and Brooke Lopez, while his use was also high in the league's top 40.
As Simmons has shown excellent control of the striker's potential, Enbide also has a better fit for NBA games, and Okaford's position is unlikely to be so solid.
Over the past two seasons, Thompson's use has stabilized at the top 20 of the league, which is also the best two seasons of his career.
The problem, though, is that with Durant's arrival, Thompson's use is bound to drop, which will inevitably affect his play.
The impact will not only be the impact of the number of shots, but the Tottenham play-off offense will certainly be significantly reduced next season, which in some ways will also reduce the opponent's defensive difficulty against him.
Durant's arrival will certainly shrink the Warriors' players, but the worst of it is Thompson.
But that doesn't mean that Townsend's level has regressed, and it's more like he has made a sacrifice for the team as a whole.
Parker's performance last season was better than the data reflected, not only because his basketball efficiency came to the top of his career, but his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs.
Duncan retired, Ginobili announced another year of fighting, and the mix of GDP eventually came to an end, as the youngest of the three, and there was not much oil in the oil tank of the French sports car.
After getting the third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell had won more regular season MVP than James, and Jordan was the only one with the FMVP more than James.
Oh, yes, James has just brought the first professional sports champion trophy for Cleveland for the past 52 years.
James, who has come to the 14th season of his career, needs a better guarantee of physical strength to prepare for the playoffs.
As a result, James's data is likely to slide further in the regular season, and he will put more weight on Owen to take on, though he will still easily become the league's top three players.
"Be sure to develop the talent that has been learned from home in Russia."
On the 12th day of the local time, Huang Jing, president of the Chinese Federation of Chinese Overseas Chinese, said with excitement when he saw the Chinese New Network reporter.
Shortly before, she took part in a training course on Chinese talent (calligraphy, painting) from overseas Chinese cultural associations, hosted by the Chinese Foreign Affairs Office of the Chinese State Council and hosted by the University of Jinan.
When I first attended the training course, I had no idea where the painting was from, and as a result, I had been able to draw and write my own work after the training session.
After returning to Moscow, we must use the knowledge and skills we have learned to make our own contribution to the spread and promotion of Chinese culture.
At the same time, the Secretary-General of the Russian Society for the Promotion of Chinese Culture, who attended the course, also felt the same way.
She said she had made great progress with the help of the training teacher, and also felt the responsibility of being a "Chinese culture overseas communicator."
He said that after returning to Russia, he must spread and promote the traditional Chinese culture among the Chinese and the Russians who love Chinese culture.

In the seven-man rugby match final on Thursday night, the British team failed to perform well ahead of the Fiji team and was beaten by the Fiji team at the Rio de Janeiro Stadium at 43-7.
The Fiji team won gold in an unassailable performance in terms of ball control, snap-up, avoidance, cooperation, running and power, the first Olympic medal in the country's history.
Silver was also a great comfort to the defeated British team, the third silver medal for the British delegation that day, which was enough to make the British rugby team proud: They beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa all the way to the seven-man rugby game they first entered the Olympics.
Earlier in the day, the British team won the South African team by 7 to 5, which could have affected their status in the finals.
But in any case, the current Fiji team is enough to defeat a full-bodied 15-man team.
Tomorrow, at least one Briton will wear a gold medal, which may be a comfort to the British team, but it may not be. This Englishman is the Fiji team manager Ben Ryan from Wimbledon, who served as head coach of the British team.
It's not easy for the British team to achieve today's results.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's coaching, they didn't win in Adelaide's international sevens rugby match.
And now, they're just one step away from the title.
While they have been hit hard, they have also made remarkable progress.
Fiji took advantage of the opening, leaving the British team with nothing to do with it.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like hitting a string of ongoing buses, and the world series champion team had taken a five-to-0 lead when Essien Colin had stormed the flag zone.
The game was just four minutes away, and Jerry Twie scored a touchdown on the right.
12 to 0, the British team barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's powerful interceptions left the Giants general Ryan Nacarawa without a third score, but it just slowed Fiji's scoring rate.
In seven minutes, Theresa May touched the ground in the right corner. 17 to 0, the British team added insult to injury.
That Carrava scored another point, and the game... the first half had a minute left.
Then, Vatmo LaVovo broke through the British team's defense and went straight to the line.
In the middle of the break, the score was 29 to 0.
Fijians seem to have been born to play rugby sevens, and the English team is still in the first place.
That's the way it is.
The British team made a huge change in the second half and hit Fijians in the full four minutes, and the performance was already good in the first half, but then the Fiji team played a wonderful match and scored again by Joshua Tuosova.
Dan Norton created a scoring opportunity for the British team, who touched the ground at the left corner and changed the score to 36 to 7, but the game had long been in the hands of the South China Sea island nation, whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing on the platform.
The wonderful performance of the Fiji team had to be applauded.
Matt Williams stopped the Fiji team from an indifferent attack at the last moment.
At the end of the whistle, Fijians embraced, and the defeated British team could only regret it.
Earlier in the day, the Fiji team beat the Japanese team by 20 to 5 in the semi-final, while the UK was in a fierce semi-final against the South African team.
Kerr Brown helped the South African team take the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton scored in the second half with excellent footwork.
After that, England Anthony's brother, Marcus Watson, secured the team's victory with brilliant interceptions, and eventually the English team won silver.
Helen Graf and Heather Stein were inspired by the cancer coach to win the rowing gold medal
It is no exaggeration to say that this is the most moving gold medal.
From the start of the first paddle to the present, Helen Graf and Heather Stanning have received 220 punitive pull training, and the gold medal they won in Estacio da Lagoa has a more extraordinary significance.
While the paddles were only two of them, the sound of a man on board-coach Robin Williams-had been accompanied by their impact on the second consecutive women's double oar Olympic gold medal, the first pair of rowing women in the UK to reach this height.
They have maintained 39 unbeaten records and have an absolute advantage.
What we're seeing is that these two talented athletes are elegant on the water, but that's not the whole of this victory.
There's a lot of volunteer help behind every rowing gold medal, and it's their constant dedication that makes the difference, and the biggest help is a coach who learned that he was suffering from cancer 30 months ago and didn't know if he could live to see the day.
As he said, death could come at any time.
I had bladder cancer and they had surgery for me.
If surgery is not done, the cancer cells will spread throughout the body.
In this way, the situation will be much worse.
This will slightly change your opinion.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he started treatment early in 2014, bringing the impact to a minimum, although it may not be appropriate to say so in this case.
I need to get my salary, so I have to get better.
It's an incentive for me.
I live in the hospital, though they say walking a few steps is enough, but I walk around the ward 20 feet, 30 feet and 50 feet every time.
That's the starting point of everything.
The rowing movement itself is a journey, and that makes the journey a little longer.
At the moment of gold, they first thought of Williams. This morning Williams was slightly more talkative than usual in order to overcome his anxiety.
"I'm in a bad mood this week, maybe a bit extreme, but the gold medal is really remarkable," said Stein, who was once the captain of the Royal Artillery Corps, who will travel to Afghanistan.
It repeatedly told me how important it was for me, how hard it was for me, Helen, and Robin.
It was the return of Helen, Robin and I worked hard for three years.
Without Robin, we're just nobody, thank him very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have found a better trainer and coach than he did.
Helen Graf and Heather Stanning had failed in five years.
The penalties imposed on the combination are unmatched by their opponents.
Even in the final 500 meters, when the New Zealand team and the Danish team began to close, Stanton and Graf still had plenty of physical reserves.
It was a real shock at the time.
Helen called: "Keep pace and keep pace."
It's really important not to be affected by an opponent.
We have a good start, and at the same time we are not looking forward to doing something amazing.
We didn't think about the glory of today, we just wanted to make every paddle and win the game and we did.
The combination took a year to determine its own future.
Graf will marry Steve Barkhar, a TV explorer next month.
Now, though, she just wants to enjoy it.
I don't want to say it's my last game.
It's going to put too much pressure on me.
In London, it took me about six months to realise I was an Olympic champion.
It's a whole new experience and I feel very nervous.
It's been about four minutes now.
"I feel better," she said.

Bulgaria's inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was 1 percent in July.
It was the highest inflation rate for several years (since June 2012), with inflation hitting zero for the first time last October (0.2% inflation).
Compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015), the annual average inflation rate for the past 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) was-0.8%.
Compared to June 2016, the consumer price index for July 2016 was 101.0%, or a monthly inflation rate of 1.0%.
The rate of inflation so far this year (July 2016 versus December 2015) was-0.2%, compared to July 2015, when the annual inflation rate for July 2016 was-0.2%.
Prices for the following categories of consumer goods rose in July 2016 compared to last month: Food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), traffic (1.8%), entertainment and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), and other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%), medical treatment (0.1%).
Alcohol and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, natural gas and other fuels, communications and education were the same as prices last month.
Snapchat's "animation" effect is meant to satirize Asians
Snapchat said the filter was inspired by animation, but some observers thought it was racially colored.
Snapchat's 150 million daily users can change reality through its filter tools and make people ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a role in a Roy Leicenstein painting.
These lenses have the effect of passivation and bending characteristics, producing more than 30 million modified self-shots each day.
Any mistake will be immediately noticed by the public.
The Snapchat lens has been criticised for being inspired to play black or to be beautiful with white skin.
So when the app provided some users this week with a filter that could create oblique, strange teeth and powder face effects, some critics called it a racial irony to the "yellow race" in Asia.
They even think that these recurring problems mean the company has a bigger problem with diversity.
Reports of the Verge and Motherboard on Wednesday sparked outrage after Snapchat said it removed the feature.
The company's explanation: The filter is a tribute to the cartoon character, not the irony of Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of the damaging stereotype in reality.
Others are also firmly opposed to these cartoon images.
South Korean American art, who tweeted about the photos and was widely shared, said in an email that the filters were "at least uncomfortable and uncomfortable."
"It's hard to distinguish between the extremely disgusting Asian satirical image and the effect of the filter," she added.
Although the filter mirror is not only yellow, the yellow race is extremely demeaning.
Snapchat is not the only company that touches these cultural bottom lines.
From the corporate board to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, American culture seems to have been advocating diversity and inclusion.
Snapchat's large young group is likely to be sensitive because it is more focused on racial diversity than the older generation.
When a filter in Snapchat produced an image of insulting the user, Judy, 25, said in an interview Thursday: "This kind of thing is more likely to be seen than before."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, who served as product manager and engineer at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article written for Medium and a telephone interview, she said she thought the race dispute reflected Snapchat's lack of racial diversity in the recruitment process.
Ms Zhu criticized the company's staff as mostly white, the leadership was all male and added a label at the end of the article: "Delta Snapchat."
As a Chinese American, Ms Zhu said: "Either they don't have a variety of people in their staff so they can make such a decision, or there are some people of color among their staff, but their positions can't let them speak up."
Other observers shared the complaint that she had not been responded to by Snapchat.
The company did not release data on staff diversity and said it was a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial background of its staff, but a spokesman said the company had recently hired a recruiter dedicated to focusing on the lower proportion of the population and promoting internal inclusion.
Ms Zhu said she would close her Snapchat account: "I wonder if they need more users like us to oppose the act."
Congressional panel said military officials distorted ISIS intelligence
In a report released on Thursday, a congressional panel noted that officials at the U.S. Central Command had changed intelligence reports that described the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria as more optimistic than the actual situation.
The interim report comes from a dedicated working group formed by the House Military Commission, the Intelligence Committee and the Republican chairman of the Defense Sub-committee of the House Appropriations Committee, which said there was "widespread dissatisfaction" among central command intelligence analysts who said the superiors were tampering with their assessment of the U.S. fight against ISIS.
Central Command (Centrcom), located in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news report on the report, "intelligence reviewed by senior leaders of the Central Command has been more optimistic about US counter-terrorism operations than in reality, and has always been more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies."
"The conduct of the Central Command is difficult to accept, while our fighters are suffering from war and the other side is the wrong analysis by top policy makers," the California Republican representative said.
The leadership issue of the Central Command has extended to the highest level of the agency.
The report details the long-standing problems of the Central Command in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analysing the training of Iraqi forces in the United States.
While there is no certainty that senior officials at the Obama administration ordered changes to the reports, according to the report, the analysts felt they were under pressure from leaders of the Central Command to make them more optimistic about the threat of ISIS or ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimony were much more optimistic than they actually were," the report said.
For example, a Central Command official said publicly that it was possible to take a large military operation as early as April or May 2015 to take back Mosul.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under Islamic State control.
"After months of investigation, the result is clear," Kansas Republican representative Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most of the top intelligence officials at the U.S. Central Command controlled the command's intelligence products, concealing the threat from ISIS.
The Republican Party has set up a dedicated working group after learning from analysts that intelligence about ISIS has been manipulated.
As the investigation continues, more will be found following the report released Thursday.
The Attorney General of the Ministry of Defence has also conducted a long-term investigation into the Central Command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released its findings on Thursday, in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican dedicated working group.
"Between 2014 and 2015, the Central Command developed an overly narrow process for intelligence assessments of Islamic State and Iraqi peacekeeping forces," the committee's Democratic leader, Representative Sheda, said in a statement.
Mr Xie said the process "hampered the release of intelligence," reduced the morale of analysts and "could not accept different opinions."
But Mr Xie and Democrats also said they had found no evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on analysts at the Central Command, so that their conclusions were in line with "presupposition or political narrative."
The Beast Daily reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of the congressional investigation.
In August last year, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon Attorney General began an investigation after receiving a complaint from the Central Command analyst.
Pentagon spokesman Navy Major Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Defense Ministry did not comment on the congressional report before the attorney general's investigation was over.
But he said: "Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense encourage a healthy dialogue on these important national security themes."
The impact of the investigation has exceeded the question of whether U.S.-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria have achieved (an increasing number of defense officials have claimed) success.
But last year, those claims made the public question the extent to which President Obama could trust the assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas released by the Central Command.
Criticism of the Islamic State newspaper was reminiscent of the controversy more than a decade ago, when Gregory Hook, an intelligence analyst at the Central Command, wrote a research article stating that George Bush's administration, despite the opposition of many analysts, insisted on sending small troops to Iraq and hardly considering what happened after the 2003 invasion.
Mr Hooker played a key role in the opposition to the Islamic State newspaper.
Last year, officials said Mr Hooker's team had concluded that airstrikes against Islamic State refineries did not significantly reduce the economic income of terrorist organizations, as the terrorist organization built temporary refineries to continue to sell oil on the black market, which is quite different from the statement released.
According to Time Week's September report, the Central Command did not release the discovery.
Central Command Commander Lloyd Austin III was criticized last year after multiple lawyers reviewed Senate testimony about an overoptimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and is currently being replaced by Joseph Vettel in his position at the Central Command.
The United States won four straight wins in the women's hockey game and will fight with the UK
Katie Barham, who was only three yuan in the 6-1 victory over Japan, took the lead on Thursday for the U.S. women's hockey team, helping the U.S. team beat India by 3 to 0.
Five goals in two games were amazing, but Barm, 27, said she didn't know she had such an excellent performance.
"I don't know anything about it," she said.
I'm not the kind of person who will remember that I've scored a few goals.
What she knows is that the U.S. team has won four straight wins at the Olympics and will compete with the team for the team's first defeat after winning the Japanese team by 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States met in the first round of Saturday's final match.
Both teams were promoted to the quarter-finals, which would determine who appeared in the group's first position.
The team that got the team first would avoid meeting a strong Dutch team so that it could go further. The Dutch came out in the first place of the other team.
In Saturday's game, the U.S. team created wonders with amazing performance, knowing that the U.S. team was at the bottom of 12 teams at the London Olympics four years ago.
Bam was also in that team at the time.
Bam, who grew up in Braubel, Pennsylvania, first picked up the hockey stick at the age of 3 (her twin sister was engaged in the sport in Drexel) and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming the youngest member of the national team so far.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because of failing to be selected for the final list.
Both she and her teammates were not bullish in 2012.
The following year, British Clegg Pynum served as head coach and everything began to change.
"It's a cultural, mental and substantive change," Mr Bam said.
We didn't reach the current level in London at the time.
We came to a complete finish.
On Thursday night, Bam scored a near-distance backhand shot in the first half.
India has yet to win the game, but the team has shown amazing tenacity and kept the 1-0 score to the end of the third quarter, when Bam broke out.
She took the ball along the left side of the field, then cut into the middle road, pumping the net, the U.S. team 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The United States rivals Jackie Burgess for the first time in the race for the first time, in the first three wins, opponents each scored one goal.
This time she was an extraordinary player.
Bam, too.
"We're in a good state right now," Pynum said, "but how good it will depend on the results of Saturday's game.
The cold and sour food of the Great Depression during the Great Recession
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had just been elected president, sat in the president's office for lunch.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt likes Fifth Avenue food, such as goose liver sauce and Maryland stew.
That day, his menu was simple: Tomato paste devil eggs, mashed potatoes and dried fruit pudding as a snack.
"It's about being in the food with the people who are suffering," said Jane Zigman.
Her husband, Andrew Corbyn, added: "It also reflects the way Americans eat."
The couple, who live in the Brooklyn Highlands, are food historians.
Mr Koch's last book, "Fried Cookies," is about Chinese food in the United States, while Ms. Zigman tells the story of the slum tenants through food in her "97 orchard."
Their new book, The Big Bowl, will be published on Tuesday by Harper Press, which describes food history in the United States during the Great Depression.
After showing some common insights on food, they met a reporter at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a simple lunch counter in the iron zone, which has been open since the economic rout of 1929.
Ms Zigman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and a broken olive sandwich, while Mr Koch, 57, ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meat roll, which the couple thought was suitable for discussing the diet during the Great Depression.
"Bread was very popular at the time," Ms. Zigman said.
There were peanut bread, liver bread, and soy bread.
They are made of a raw material and a cheap pouring head that can be poured on the raw material.
Imagine that your dinner is all peanuts.
Mr Coe made a strange appearance.
"They're definitely like lead in your stomach," he said.
In the years leading up to the Great Depression, American Donton was a buffet, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cook meals for male farm workers, breakfast, lunch and dinner.
In the First World War, it was the Americans who sent food to the hungry Europeans. The big meal recorded how the country suddenly ceased to be a rich place.
Mr Koch explained why he and his wife were going to write the book: "At the time, food had become a major topic of unhappiness for Americans."
Another unpleasant topic was the cold-sour new food: "Fan food," such as bread and stew, became the main course, and the stew was "the best recipe for leftovers," Ms. Zigman said, because the cooks could use the cream in the sauce to cover up the hard food.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, which has been featured on the American dining table for years, has become a rare luxury.
The odd bungalow only considers calories, more than taste or even basic culinary common sense, and the first thing people consider is nutrition.
In studying the book, including a variety of recipes, Ms. Zigman made a baked onion filled with peanut oil.
"This is not common at the dinner table," Mr Koko said.
"It's too weird," Ms Zigman said.
Peanut oil and roast onions can't be matched at all.
This is a feature of many family economic meals.
Family economists have influenced the country's eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, who served as head chef of the Federal Office for Family Economics from 1923 to 1943, which has been unique in history.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines that encourage women to be "careful" and have the courage to turn bad foods such as cream spaghetti with carrots into gourmet food.
The big meal is a great "historical treasure."
What's particularly interesting is the government's response to hungry people, such as President Herbert Hoover's "other people's business."
While he openly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse in childhood, his diet was as delicate as a millionaire.
"He likes to eat European Western food, such as fish and cucumber sauce," Mr Koo said.
He was wearing an evening dress and dining in a gilded dining room.
He was clearly separated from the people.
If not his wife Eleanor encouraged him to set an example in his diet, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
As the book says, the housekeeper hired by Ms. Roosevelt has no interest in taste, so "food in the White House is not only the hardest food in Washington, but also the worst food for cooking."
As soon as the United States returned to normal, many of the Depression-era cooking styles were abandoned.
Ms Zigman said what was left was our focus on calories and nutrition and the application of science to cooking.
The couple said they learned more about Ms Zigman's mother's eating habits when writing the book, such as how she didn't throw the food away.
"She was very scared to waste food," Mr Coe said.
"She actually made many people sick," Ms. Zigman recalled.
For example, there has been a "cream bubble" event.
After removing the plate, she and Mr Coe took out a dessert they had prepared at home: This is the fruit pudding that President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It's called the cream fruit," Ms. Zigman said, adding that a new name for a common dish is "the usual trick."
There was no cream in the dessert, only dried fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
It was hard to put the spoon into the thick brown paste.
Unexpectedly, the dessert tastes good.
Mr Coe ate a second spoon and a third spoon.
He thought it was an acceptable dessert, and told his wife, "It would be better to add some chopped walnuts."
Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July, with Saudi production hitting a new high.
The report could not help but cast doubt on the credibility of OPEC, and the path to a recovery in oil prices is still fraught with thorns.
On Monday, OPEC's Chairman-in-Office and Qatar Energy Secretary Saada said OPEC would hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28.
The monthly report released by OPEC on Wednesday showed that the entire OPEC group, including Gabon, rose 46,000 barrels / day in July to 33.11 million barrels / day.
OPEC also said in the monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil, adding to the level of oversupply in the market.
The news, combined with an increase in crude oil production expectations and an unexpected increase in crude oil stocks, fell for two days in a row.
As of Wednesday, light crude oil futures, which were delivered in September by the New York Mercantile Exchange, fell 2.48%, and London Brent crude futures, which were delivered in October, fell 207%.
Reuters believes the proposed meeting of oil-producing countries is unlikely to tighten supply, and figures released by the U.S. Energy Information Agency also depress market sentiment.
Iran's official news agency, Fars, quoted Iran's oil minister Zigagane on Wednesday as saying Iran's daily crude oil production was up to 3.85 million barrels, the highest level since 2008.
As news of the meeting came out, Russian energy minister Nowak said there was no need for a new round of frozen production negotiations under the current oil price.
The last meeting of oil producers was already in April, and OPEC members failed to reach agreement on any measures.
Emma Richards, a BMI Research oil and gas analyst, said markets and the media might overreact to OPEC's upcoming meeting.
Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC would change the mood of the market by releasing signals that they would contribute to the agreement.
It's like the smoke and mirrors that draw people's eyes (deliberately wrong).
Eugen Weinberg, head of commodity research at German Commercial Bank, said the possibility of OPEC trying to stabilize the market through the September meeting was low.
This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, which, after all, has staged a "wolf coming."
All parts of the country should release medical advertising, complaint reporting concentration, and medical institutions that have been punished multiple times as a spot-check.
The National Health and Family Planning Commission and the National Bureau of Traditional Chinese Medicine will organize, in due course, the supervision and inspection of special supervision and inspection work in some provinces.
According to the media, due to the massive influx of capital into Internet medicine, the current problem of homogenization of products is serious, the investment boom has receded and capital has entered the wait-and-see period.
Internet medical companies have died in large numbers within a year of starting a business, and about 20% of start-up Internet-based medical businesses are no longer available, according to the University of Hong Kong Management Research Centre.
However, just as most internet-based healthcare companies struggle to finance their way to the A or B round, there are several sub-sector leading companies that still have access to capital heat.
It seems that Internet medical start-up must not be "a hive," but should look at the market demand, sink the heart to do special, do deep.
Fish jumped $1.200 million, or 40% of the registered capital, and nine state-owned equipment companies contributed $18.00 million, or 60% of registered capital.
In recent years, with the state's policy support in medical informationization, the electronic and integrated supply chain management system has gradually entered hospitals at all levels.
The cooperation between the fish and Kyushu is aimed at the demand of the market, helping the hospital to build the advanced supply chain management system, and using this as an opportunity to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many Internet medical companies, iBaby has initially focused on the vertical field of Internet obstetrics, deep ploughing mothers and doctors at both ends.
Expectant mothers are not only available for free 24 hours and one-on-one doctors, but can also pay for medical advice.
At the doctor's end, iBaby breaks geographical limits by organizing experts to give grassroots doctors online lectures, peer-to-peer exchanges, case discussions, etc.
At present, doctors open three plates, respectively, for doctors to continue education, doctor social and doctor help.
Provision includes online learning, case discussion, academic exchanges; social platforms with hospitals, doctors of the same department; legal aid, entrepreneurial support and other services needed for doctor-patient relationships or personal life.
According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently said Ali's health was "willing to sink in" to take down health data.
Internet companies, data companies lack professionalism, there is no uniformity in the writing method on the same word.
Ali's current layout in the field of health care is divided into three parts, namely, Ali Health, Sky Cat Medical Center and PayPal Future Hospital.
Wang Lei admitted that health-care entrepreneurship would be harder than other industries, "it's not just about how much money is going on, it's going to sink in, and stand alone and slow to do it."
Staying up late to watch Olympic events can easily damage the heart
Brazil's Olympic Games are in full swing, and even when the event is broadcast at home in the middle of the night, many members of the public will stay up late to watch.
In response, doctors are particularly reminded that staying up late to watch the event has health risks and is likely to cause cardiovascular disease.
If you stay up late for a long time, the hormone will still be secreted, and people will continue to be in a state of intense excitement, unable to get a normal recovery, prone to vasoconstriction and elevated blood pressure, resulting in cardiovascular disease.
Han Zhiyuan is particularly reminded that groups with high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood lipid, smoking habits, family history and other cardiovascular risk factors may be more likely to cause cardiovascular disease if they stay up late.
If you stay up for a long time, not only can cardiovascular function be affected, but gastrointestinal function, immune system, neuroendocrine system will be affected, and even the risk of developing tumors will increase.
For elderly friends, Han Zhiyuan suggested that try not to stay up late in order to watch Olympic games, especially those with cardiovascular disease history.
During the last "World Cup" football match, Han Zhiyuan had visited a patient in his 60s, whose myocardial infarction was triggered or linked to a night-watching game.
Han Zhiyuan said that since this year, its department has received some 25-year-old myocardial infarction or stroke patients, which is largely caused by the patient's long-lived lifestyle.
Don't stay up late every day, occasionally stay up late to watch the favorite sports, other projects may wait the next day to watch the replay of the event.
When you stay up late, add moisture and eat more fruit, preventing blood vessels from clogging and enhancing the immunity of the body.

In March 2016, the Rio Olympics came to an end with eight years to qualify for the women's 10m Air Rifle Olympics.
On August 6, 2016, in the women's 10m air rifle event at the Rio Olympics, Durie won silver in 207 rings.
On August 12, 2016, the bronze medal was won in three poses of the women's 50m rifle in the Rio Olympics.
The film is expected to debut early next year on CCTV and Lessee, and the VR panoramic version will be launched for the first time.
The documentary "Polar" is a large-scale work that focuses on the third pole of the Earth's Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, with a new perspective on the traditional and modern blend of Tibet and the story of Tibet's interaction with the world.
The biggest advantage of VR works is to give viewers a unique sense of "immersion," which also puts higher demands on the shooting process.
The polar panoramic VR special version of the production team said they wanted to make sure that every location was impeccable, giving viewers a sense of their own.
On August 11, the armed police Shandong general team Yantai detachment organized the special war sniper to take 34 degrees Celsius high temperature to the Kunyu Mountain to carry out the jungle training.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union brought missiles into Cuba, which nearly led to a nuclear war in the United States.
The incident was seen as the pinnacle of the Cold War, known as the "Cuban missile crisis."
But it is little known that, also during the Cold War, a strong solar storm had nearly led to a nuclear war by the United States against the Soviet Union, which was not published by researchers for the first time until 9 August.
On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm caused intense interference with the U.S. military's radar and radio communications in the Arctic.
These radars are part of the U.S. ballistic missile warning system for monitoring Soviet missiles.
The paper, which was completed by researchers at the University of Colorado, interviewed US military personnel involved in forecasting and analyzing solar activity at the time and consulted non-confidential literature.
In the 1960s, to prevent a sudden nuclear war in the Soviet Union, the U.S. Air Force has always had a number of warplanes carrying nuclear warheads in the sky, the paper wrote.
The U.S. military commander did not know that the disruption was caused by the sun storm rather than the Soviet Union, and ordered the warplanes to enter combat readiness.
Fortunately, the American military's solar activity, which began in the late 1950s and its research on electromagnetic interference on Earth, ultimately stopped the potential military conflict.
Later, he summarized the information provided by the Air Weather Service of the United States Air Force and submitted a detailed report.
The immediate consequence of this solar storm is that the U.S. military has since viewed space weather as a combat concern and has established a stronger space weather forecasting system.
In their day-to-day work, the public found that the car was blocked by unfamiliar vehicles, and that it was possible to use the "micro-mail vehicle" function to solve the problem in the absence of an unfamiliar vehicle driver.
Since August 11, Xi'an traffic police micro-letter service number "Xi'an traffic police" launched the "micro-letter vehicle" service.
When the service is rolled out, in daily life, citizens can solve such problems by using the "micro-mail vehicle" function if they obstruct their vehicle in the event that the driver is not on the scene.
This new service function is fast, save administrative cost; second, respect and protect the personal privacy of citizens; three is all-weather and full-time service.
As long as the public has a micro-letter, it can be very convenient to operate on its own, in a way that makes it easier for both sides to "meet" each other, ease parking problems and reduce the number of security cases involving the car.
On the other hand, in the case of owners who refuse to move, illegally park or obstruct the passage of traffic, Xi'an administrative department said the traffic police will take different disposal measures according to the actual situation and deal with it as appropriate.
On August 9, in the cultural tourism area of Dingfeng County, Danfeng County, more than 10 young workers and staff from Shang Lo Power Supply Company came here to carry out the "Xiangjiangzhen Power of Power" and our festival-themed event.
In combination with the construction of spiritual civilization, the company of Danfeng County, Lufeng Power Supply Company, has been actively organizing the activities of "Yuanyu Ancient Town with Power" and our festival, the theme of the festival.
"Our usual focus is on work and learning, lack of time and platform to communicate with colleagues and friends," said the company's staff.
"This time the company provides us with such a relaxed, happy, harmonious platform that I love, meaningful and interesting."
The seven-day event has been widely acclaimed by the youth workers at the scene, and hopes that the company will organize more such activities later, and strengthen communication and exchanges with more young people.
The attention of the Beijing Olympic men's singles champion, Spain superstar Nadal on the same day in the men's singles match against rival promotion to the top eight, the men's double race to the final.
As the Golden Slam winner, Nadal, who has a keen interest in the Olympics, has not recovered from his wounds, the three-line attack, with a lot of success.
He and his team-mate, Lopez, competed for gold in the men's double final with Romanian player Tekau and Meg.
The Rio Olympic women's singles project encountered multiple seed competitors, after a few days of fierce competition, the women's singles 11 day.
Kovitova will compete with Puig for a ticket to the final, while another final seat will be generated between Case and Corbyn.
The top four of the women's doubles were also produced, with the semi-finals in the semi-finals: Hingis / Barsinski against Herdka / Heravalcanva; Maracova / Viennina against Strickova / Savolova.
The mixed doubles game of the day also hit the top eight, although the number one seed Ma Hu / Garcia combination of the Lok Ma, as well as the Nean combination of the retreat, made the mixed game slightly pale.
On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly published a new version of the US-Japan Defense Cooperation Guide in New York, allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role globally.
It was the day when US Defense Secretary Carter, US Secretary of State Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Yasuo Fukuda and Japan's defense minister, Zhong Gu Yuan, attended a news conference in New York.
This is the fifth time a Chinese folk think tank has published a Japanese military assessment report and a fourth edition of the English version.
The report is divided into nine chapters, including general policy adjustment, military strength, defense budget, military deployment, weapons equipment, institutional development reform, military training, foreign military security cooperation, and military security relations with China.
2015 was the year when Abe's government pushed ahead with major policy adjustments in the field of security for several years, the report said.
Since then, Japan's initiatives in the field of security will be mainly on the operational level of the application of the rule of law, strategic implementation and policy implementation, rather than significant adjustments and changes in the framework, mechanisms and policies.
The report stressed that Abe's cabinet tried to push Japan's "normal nationalisation," the self-defense forces to step out into international security affairs, strengthen the alliance between Japan and the United States, and protect China from China, through the above three breakthroughs.
Previously, the China Association for the Promotion of Strategic Culture issued Japan's military assessment report on 5 June 2012, July 19, 2013, July 23, 2014, and June 30, 2015.
The Financial Times released an atlas of the residence of the U.S. ambassador to China on August 12.
In contrast, the U. S. ambassador's residence, in contrast, can be seen as a safe house in the next movie, adapted from John Lekley's Cold War spy novel.
The residence was grey and was heavily defended with outlying fences, a second layer of interior walls, barbed wire and vehicle barricades.
To complement the public sports facilities short board
The black coal-field warehouse, turned into a "green grass" football field; the red brick top of the factory, became the modern sports hall.
On the National Fitness Day, the south fall horse camp sports culture park outside the Wangjiang River in Hangzhou, opened the mysterious veil.
It used to be a coal field and has been idle since it was closed more than a decade ago, leaving a lot of illegal buildings and living waste.
After the renovation, it became a sports cultural park and will officially open to the public in November, offering free sports venues to the public, and undoubtedly opening up a whole new fertile ground for sports for all.
This reminds me of Hangzhou Chen's body school, the Chinese swimming pool "Huangpu Military Academy" swimming out a number of world champions.
The swimming pool has a steady stream of real estate, which vividly explains the relationship between competitive sports and popular sport-the rich mass base provides good conditions for the selection of professional players.
The level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of national sports, and competitive sports depends on the whole sport in a certain sense, and the sport of the whole country depends on the conditions of the field.
As of 2015, the number of sports venues per person in China, although already 150 times the size of the founding of New China, is still far behind the sports powers, according to the report.
In June, the State Council issued the National Fitness Plan (2016-2020), which focused on the development of mass sports.
In order to complement this short board, on the one hand, the relevant departments should take full account of the layout of the sports venue in the planning of the city.
On the other hand, the established public sports venues, including sports venues in units such as schools, should be as open as possible to maximize the efficiency of their use.
The Rio Olympics, which are now in full swing, inspire enthusiasm for sport, as well as a sense of engagement.
Geely gets his lawyer's fees in the battle with Merck's hepatitis C patent
According to the U.S. District Judge's verdict, Gillette Science is entitled to legal fees arising from the hepatitis C patent lawsuit with the pharmaceutical company Merck Group.
In June, after U.S. judges found that Merck was guilty of wrongdoing, including perjury and other unethical behaviour, Gillett was exempt from paying $200 million in compensation for two patents by Geely's best-selling drug, Sofib and Harvani, which violated Merck's company.
In Thursday's lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Beth Lanbosson Freeman said Geely did not have to bear the costs incurred as a result of the defense.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gillette Gillett, who ruled the new generation of hepatitis C drug markets, to cure more than 90 percent of hepatitis patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gillard and Merck sued each other, both claiming to be an effective ingredient in the Geely drug, the owner of the lab work in Sofib.
U.S.-backed forces announced they had recaptured Manbion from the Islamic State
A force spokesman said on Friday that the remaining Islamic State soldiers in the city had all left and that US-backed forces had fully controlled the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border.
Following the departure of militants in the city, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now sweeping the town.
Sharon Dalveish of the Military Commission of the Syrian Democratic Forces Manbiseason told Reuters that they had rescued more than 2,000 civilians who had been hijacked by militants.
"Manbiseason is all under our control now, but we're still doing the sweep," he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paying 34.2 percent of federal taxes
Hillary Clinton posted her 2105 tax returns on Friday, with the declaration showing the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband earning $10.75 million in 2015 and paying a 34.2 percent federal tax.
In 2015, the Clintons' charitable contributions amounted to $1 million, most of which contributed to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton's speech fee reached nearly $5.3 million, while the former secretary of state earned $3 million from publisher Simon and Schuster with a book about her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's campaign partner, Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, released a 10-year tax return.
The two paid a federal tax of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane will continue to be a benchmark for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In contrast, Donald Trump covered up on false grounds and retracted his previous commitment to release tax returns.
Although the law does not require it, in accordance with established practice, US presidential candidates should make public their tax returns.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyer cited the IRS audit as a reason to refuse to publish a tax return.
Ian Sam, the Clinton campaign aide, tweeted that it was up to you, and attached a single link to the Democratic nominee's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special legal adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release tax returns until the audit was completed.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republicans, said Trump's refusal to publish tax returns would raise questions about its net worth, charitable donations, business deals and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton seized on the issue and posted a network video on Friday highlighting high-profile Democrats urging Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, she raised the issue in Michigan's economic policy speech.
"For decades, he refused to release his own tax returns like other presidential candidates," she told the crowd.
According to CNN, Trump had barely paid a penny for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted multiple tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, all of whom said the current situation might remain so.
The federal tax has become a big issue in the presidential race.
Clinton named a rule in the name of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, guaranteeing that people earning more than $1 million a year pay at least 30% tax.
President Obama also supported the offer.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, in Berkshire Hathaway, where Mr Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also being audited by the IRS and that Trump was "scared" not by tax authorities, but by voters.
The earliest tax returns published by the Clinton campaign team were in 2007.
The Clinton couple, who currently live in Chakbuck, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014, with a combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clinton couple's 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, their wage income is only $100.
Their main investment is low-cost index mutual funds, and the Clintons' dividend and interest income is $109,000.

Jewish filmmakers criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israeli phone code in line with Arab customers' "demands" -- Reuters News
A French filmmaker with Jewish ancestry revealed to the media that the Kelbinski Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's phone code, and that hotel staff said it was according to the "demands" of Arab customers, which sparked public opinion.
Claudio Longzman, author of the Jewish Holocaust documentary, The Holocaust, expressed his disappointment at the Kebinski hotel and published an open letter in Germany's Frankfurt Report.
During the recent stay, Longzman wanted to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
But Israel is not among the countries where guests can speak directly from the room.
Has Israel disappeared in Germany's capital, Berlin, in 2016?
Longzman wrote.
Instead, guests can call the Israeli phone via the call center of the Kelbinski Hotel.
To seek an explanation, the filmmaker asked the hotel's front desk.
In his letter, Longzman said the reply he had received at the front desk "shocked him."
Hotel staff said it was "a deliberate decision by the Kelbinski hotel management."
And the reason for doing so is to make the filmmaker angry.
Longzman cited the employee's original words: Most of our guests were Arabs and they asked for the removal of Israeli code.
According to the South Germany Daily, the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Haidas Handelsmann, described the matter as a "shame."
We were surprised to learn of the incident.
It was a huge shame in itself.
And that happens in Germany and that chain hotel is a disgrace.
There is no need for any explanation for this matter.
"We hope the hotel will be able to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident sparked hot talk online, and everyone thought it was a scandal.
It was thought that the Kelbinski hotel was simply "servile" to meet the demands of Arab customers.
Another post pointed to the hotel "really not to face" and pointed out that the main street in the famous Kudamm street was near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly clarified all charges, claiming everything was "negligent" and expressed "apologetic" to Lanzman, according to the Daily Mirror.
"There has never been a direct order to remove Israel from a fast dial list," the South German Daily quoted the representative of Kabinski as saying.
The newspaper also said Israeli code had been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets to evict the protesting Brazilian student
On Thursday, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, students clashed with police in protest over the reform of the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to evict protesters.
The incident was caused by law enforcement officials trying to disperse students, so police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the march, expressing their dissatisfaction with the programs.
To save money, San Paul State Gov. Oakming plans to close 100 public schools and 300,000 students will be transferred to school.
Some of the students who took part in the protest expressed dissatisfaction with the temporary president, Michelle Temel, through graffiti on the wall.
Just days before a recent protest, protesters collectively took to the streets to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the state Senate.
Scottish cyclist Carl Skinner won the gold medal after winning the gold medal
Scottish cyclist Carl Skinner helped the British trio to successfully defend the Olympic gold medal after the 2012 London Olympics last night in the Rio cycling men's group race.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist replaced his Scottish compatriot, Sir Chris Howie, as the backbone of the team, and the legendary cyclist was proud of him when the young Skinner beat the title favourites New Zealand.
Four years ago, the English team was amazing, and Hoy captured the fifth of the individual's six Olympic gold medals.
The British team was only sixth in the world cycling field championships in London in March, and Howie has since retired.
The problem for the British team during the Beijing Olympics to the London Olympics was to change the "first circle of experts" Jeremy Gustav.
The motorcade did just that when Sanders appeared.
Howie's retirement also left a blank, while Jon Imadi and Matt Cranton wanted to fill the gap.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the British men's team coach insisted that he be selected for the national team, and Skinner ended up with no expectations.
Skinner's partner was Sanders and Kenny, who won gold with Howie four years ago, and the trio refreshed the Olympic record in qualifying, but the achievement was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
And the three British cyclists eventually beat their opponents and won gold medals.
While Sanders was slightly behind, Kenny made the lead for the team, and Skinner kept the lead to the end.
The change in strategy is key to this reversal, with Sanders choosing the larger flywheel, so the pace is slower, which allows Kenny, especially Skinner, to keep pace.
Hoy watched the game as a BBC commentator. Skinner, Kenny and Sanders saw him as they boarded the podium.
"It makes me flattered," said Skinner, a 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist.
I'm just doing everything I can to make myself famous.
We created the Olympic record in the final and beat the world champion.
It's incredible.
Nothing is better than this victory.
After winning gold with Kenny and Howie at the 2012 London Olympics, Sanders admitted deliberately falling on the track in a bad start.
Later, he withdrew the comments, and the British team's opponents were unable to appeal.
And this victory has no such problem.
"It's like in London, the platform is all on the British flag," Mr Hinders said.
We just had a team three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world champions, so it's amazing to be able to defend the Olympic title.
It's just a game and a gold medal for the British team that won seven of the 10 field cycling gold medals at the Beijing Olympics and the London Olympics.
If this symbolizes the progress we have made over the past five months, then we will continue to be successful at the Bicycle Museum over the next five days.
According to Kenny's state, he is not unlikely to recreate Hoy's feat of winning three gold medals at an Olympics.
If so, 12 years younger than Howie and also on March 23 (the day seems to be the sacred day of the British sport, Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born on the day) Kenny will have six gold medals and a silver medal.
The score was flat with Howie.
Kenny will then play for a three-day race starting today.
The 28-year-old Bolton said: "I will focus on the game for a while.
Team games are always the best.
You can win games with teammates.
Frankly, one win is a bit lonely.
"If he can win the other two gold medals, then he should be given a knighthood," Mr Sinders said.
It was the only game of the day to produce a medal, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Duer promoted the four-man four-kilometre group pursuit with the fastest grades.
Their score was 351.993.
The world record for gold medalists in the 2012 London Olympics was 351.65.
The first round and the final (10: 42 p.m.) on the second day of the day, Wiggins will undoubtedly be the focus of attention.
Yesterday he had a dispute with the game officer before qualifying, when the match officials asked him to measure height.
In the women's group, which is due to end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rotherl Shade, Eleanor Barker and Kate Archibald from Milcover are promoted to a new world record of 413.260.
The British team relies on a strong field cycling team to take the initiative in the middle of the Olympics and win multiple medals.
After showing its absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British cycling team was slightly disappointed in their journey to Rio.
There have been many setbacks during the period, including the resignation of April technical director Sean Satton as a result of gender discrimination and bullying charges and the retirement of legends such as Hoy, Victoria Pendleton.
But the bike pavilion's first game night is enough to prove that the British team will again play the key moment to reach its peak.
After little life comes to this world, Mom and Dad are responsible for this life, which is responsible not only for the physical health of the child, but also for the development of the spirit, that is, education.
If you fail in your children's education, even if your career is successful, it can't make up for the lack of life and the failure of the family.
When a new life comes, new parents will take time to look after and educate their children and take responsibility for him.
And responsibility, in addition to being embodied in the body's care, making them healthy, is also in spiritual education, which is to let children learn how to be human, how adults, how to succeed.
Good family education means parents need to always accompany their children, care for their children, patient care, and also need to teach children to develop civilized behavior and behavior, so that children can learn more knowledge and improve their intelligence.

So parents need to be a good example in front of their children, standardize their words and deeds, and cultivate their good character, which can indirectly help the child shape a good heart and make him better.
Amy is a smart and beautiful girl.
She is outgoing and lively, is able to get along well with friends, and has a good adaptability to the environment.
But Amy has a little secret in her heart: She can't focus on the learning, work tasks she's going to do for a long time.
This secret has been with Amy for a long time. The problem is not serious.
Even through decentralized, modular time to study and work, she basically can finish the task and get good grades.
But when the task was heavy and the time was tight, Amy felt very painful and tortured.
The individual's resistance to self-exposure and his emotional experience is designed not to threaten individual self-awareness and self-esteem.
Some behaviorist psychologists understand the impedance as an individual's disobedience to their behavior correction.
I tried to get Amy to do a practice that allowed her to calm herself down by breathing relaxed, to feel that ordeal.
And once he left the trapped situation, she felt relaxed and regained her freedom.

Uber entered the Taiwan market for four years and has had a small impact on the local traditional taxi industry.
On 12 August, more than 100 taxis traveled around Taiwan's "administrative court" to protest, leading to severe traffic paralysis in the surrounding area, Taiwan's joint newspaper reported on August 12.
The director of the Taipei driver's union, Zheng Lijia, said Uber had come to Taiwan for four years and that the Taiwan authorities had not been able to wait until the end of the month.
The government, however, did not believe in it, and dragged on.
Law-abiding taxi drivers, who belong to the bottom labour, have to compete with the illegal, unrestricted Uber and feel cheated by the authorities.
Original caption: 2,000 chickens in a farm in Jiangsu Province were sold and sold without permission by a court rancher
After the judgment came into force, because Li did not automatically fulfill the obligations set out in the judgment, Wang applied to Banyang Court for enforcement.
On October 16, 2014, the Banyang Court issued a civil ruling which ruled that 2,000 chickens in all farms in Lee were seized and were not allowed to be transferred or sold without permission.
After receiving the seizure ruling, Li privately sold some of the eggs in the farm without the permission of the Banyang court.
By March 8, 2015, when the Yangyang County Public Security Bureau surveyed, only 142 eggs were left in the farms.
On August 12, reporters learned that the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympic Games Organizing Committee issued an announcement that the Beijing Winter Olympic Committee inherited intellectual property rights such as the Beijing Winter Olympic Games emblem and logo.
No one may use the Beijing Winter Olympic Games emblem and logo for commercial purposes without the permission of the BOCOG.
The head of the Industrial Coordination Division of the National Development Reform Commission today noted here that excess steel capacity is a global problem.
China's capacity utilization rate is higher than the global average in recent years, as well as in countries and regions such as the United States and Europe.
Our country has taken resolute and effective measures to defuse excess capacity, and the results are gradually emerging.
The chief pointed out that the Party Central State Department attaches great importance to the global issue of excess steel capacity.
Departments and regions actively carry out the deployment of the State Council and carry out serious work. This year, it is necessary to reduce crude steel production by about 45 million tons.
From the situation of our country, our country does not encourage the export of steel. Instead, we take a series of practical measures to control the export of steel.
The chief stressed that international trade in steel products is essentially a market act and is an autonomous choice from the needs of the importing country and the consumer's comprehensive consideration of product value-for-money.
The implementation of trade protection measures is not conducive to a fundamental solution to the development of the global steel industry. Instead, it will only have a further impact on the international trade order.
When it comes to debt, the head stressed that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly dealt with in the process of resolving excess capacity.
As the assets of steel enterprises are large and wide-ranging, some enterprises have complex debt relationships and may cause regional risks if they are not properly disposed of.
According to the head of the department, in recent years, as the downward pressure on the economy has increased, the overall demand of society has gradually weakened, the capacity utilization rate of some industries has declined, and the production and operation of enterprises has increased.
Some enterprises do not adapt to the changes in the market environment, production and operation are not sustainable or even on the verge of collapse, but are restricted by some institutional mechanisms and have more barriers to exit in a market-oriented way and become "zombie enterprises."
The existence of such enterprises has distorted market signals, reduced the efficiency of factor resource utilization, increased the cost of social management, and hindered the establishment of a fair competition market environment.
The main causes of the losses are the same as those facing the global steel industry-poor market demand and low capacity utilization.
Our country mainly adopts the market mechanism, the economic means and the rule of law, the government is mainly to do the work of the workers and the social stability, ensure a fair and fair market order.
The head stressed that the next step is to unswervingly continue to work on capacity-building to ensure the completion of the five-year target task of resolving crude steel production of 100 million to 150 million tons.
On the afternoon of the 10th afternoon, the Chinese tourist police, who appeared at the Red Square in Moscow, immediately drew attention, with Chinese tourists waving with surprise, and locals and foreign visitors couldn't help but look back.
On the same day, China's first professional tourism police team, members of the tourism police detachment of the three-city public security bureau in Hainan Province, came to the Red Square in Moscow to communicate with the local tourist police.
Moscow Travel Police are divided into three teams on duty patrol in Red Square, Nicoliski pedestrian street, Gum department store, and the Chinese tourism police have been studying together, the whole process lasted more than an hour.
Female police officer Liuhigne, who is in her 20s this year, is fluent in English and Spanish, and she just joined the tourist police team last year.
He looked closely at the words and words of his Russian counterparts along the way, and interacted with her from time to time.
When the Spanish tourists came to consult, the Moscow tourist police had a patient explanation for each other in fluent Spanish, which impressed Wang Bing.
"Every one of Moscow's travel police has a foreign language and some more than two, which touches us very much," he said.
"Hainan, as an international tourist island, is gradually paying attention to attracting international tourists, and we hope to improve our ability to match the status of the International Tourism Island."
The Chinese tourist police also went to the Moscow city tourism police brigade to communicate with their Russian counterparts before the day's study.
"I often deal with Chinese tourists and are very happy to see them travel to Russia."
"The question they usually ask for help is: How the road goes, where a memorial is, how to rent, how to get back to the hotel."
The city's environment and tourism atmosphere in Moscow has become better and more attractive to foreign visitors in recent years, said Rezakov, chief captain of the Moscow city tourism police brigade.
To adapt to tourism development needs, a tourism police force was set up in July 2014 to patrol the major attractions to help and channel tourists.
At present, all Moscow travel police are proficient in English, in part also in Spanish and German.
The police brigade divided them into nine groups according to the foreign language level, and took two classes a week to learn self-defense, laws and regulations and foreign languages.
"There are currently two travel police officers who are starting to learn Chinese and have said well, and we have to continue to raise their Chinese level," Rezkov said.
Rezakov told reporters that the Moscow Travel Police has accumulated some experience since its formation and hopes to inspire its peers in Sanya.
He believes that cooperation between the Russian and Chinese police departments will enhance the security of their citizens to travel to each other's countries.
"The personnel recruitment, policing patterns, equipment, and good interaction with tourists in Moscow's tourism police have brought us a lot of inspiration," Chen said.
At least nine provinces and cities such as Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian and Beijing have introduced the rules for the implementation of residence permits.
For the conditions of applying for a residence permit, the above-mentioned areas generally propose that they should live for more than half a year and meet one of the conditions for lawful and stable employment, lawful stable residence and continuous attendance.
The Chinese New Network reporter noted that the "gold content" varies from place to place in terms of the treatment provided in the residence permit, and that the scope of public services and facilities provided in some areas has expanded compared to the provisions of the national version.
These areas increase the convenience for children to participate in the local college entrance examination in accordance with the relevant conditions.
In addition, Beijing, among others, has made it clear that it will gradually expand the scope of the provision of public services and facilities and publish it to society on a regular basis.
Fujian, for example, proposes to publish to society at least every three years the scope of public services and convenience enjoyed by holders of residence permits.
Under the Provisional Regulations on Residence Permit, the public security organ shall, within 15 days from the date of receiving the residence permit, make a residence permit within 15 days from the date of receiving the residence permit.
For the time limit, most areas agree with the national version, which is issued within 15 days.
Hebei makes it clear that the resident public security police station shall issue a residence permit within 3 working days from the date of receiving the application.
In the case of Jiangxi, the public security organ shall, within five working days from the date of acceptance, produce a residence permit if the conditions for applying for a residence permit are satisfied and the material is complete.
In accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on Residence Permit, the above-mentioned areas are clear and apply for a residence permit for the first time and are exempt from the cost of documentation.
Sichuan, for example, requires that public security police stations or entrusted community service agencies strictly enforce approved fees and fees, and firmly prohibit ultra-range, ultra-standard fees or ride charges.
On July 27, 2016, Chen Yang Xia, the secretary of the county committee of the original Ganzhou city, reported to the provincial committee to report to work, as the director of the party wind and wind supervision (deputy director level, probation period of one year).
The red wine that was consumed that night was provided by Li Yi, and the other expenses were borne by Liu.
The Communist Party of Jiangxi Province reported that Chen Yang Xia, Cheng Zi Liang and others in private clubhouse organized and accepted food, in violation of the central eight rules of the spirit, in violation of the Party's discipline.
Bergba ate two yellow cards last season in the Italian Cup, which will be automatically banned under the rules.
Although he has moved back to the Premier League, the FA continues to extend its cumulative ban to the Premier League.
As a result, Bergba will take a look at the away game against Bournemouth on August 14, and his return to Manchester United will be extended to the 20-day home game with Southampton.
As the first round of 12 rookie in 2014, Surrey will officially land in the NBA next season and join the Philadelphia 76 team.
Surrey was a young European player and a lot of fans didn't know much about him, but through the Olympics, it was believed that Surrey's performance was very impressive.
The last time Croatia played against Spain, Surrey successfully sealed off Paul Gasol in the final moments trying to drag the game into Calais's basket attack.
Recently, 76 team manager Brett Brown gave Surrey a high rating, and the Spurs manager thought he saw the shadow of the young Manu-Ginobili in Surrey.
It was clear that Surrey had shown his talent and made 76 people look forward to him.
Croatia's first two games at the Olympics, Surrey received 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.
In the first half, Surrey showed his ability to pull out space on the pitch, and after a break with his teammates, he could hit shots outside the three-point line.
While the 76-person insider is hoarding a lot of talented young players, they don't have Surrey's outside capacity.
From the cap to the start-up quick attack and the completion of the assists, there are only a handful of insider players who can do this in the NBA today.
Since the start of the Olympics, Surrey has scored 13 points, eight rebounds and five assists in three games.
Since deciding to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014, James has signed two 1-1 contracts in a row.
As the NBA's current collective agreement is about to enter its final year as vice president of the NBA player union, James will be at the forefront of collective bargaining negotiations.
Given the big boost in the league's revenue, it's thanks to the new TV relay agreement, as well as the fight between bosses and players about how to deal with the money, with fears that the NBA will be suspended next summer.
But for James, he doesn't have to worry about being a free player next summer because he has renewed a three-year contract with the Cavaliers.
No matter when the 2017-18 season officially starts, James is within the contract.
Since the iPhone SE's stunning debut, the mobile phone market has also ushered in a small screen boom.
Shortly before, Nubian also launched its first piece of its Z 11 series: Nubia Z 11 Mini.
Nubia Z 11 Mini continues its consistently superior photo gene and is equipped with a single hand-held 5.0-inch screen, easy-to-use and easy-to-use post-fingerprint recognition, which has achieved its remarkable experience of use.
Nubia's just-listed small screen photo cell phone Z 11 mini is down 200 yuan, from the original 1,499 yuan to 1299 yuan.
In terms of appearance, Nubia Z 11 Mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen, which is still the classic "Little Red Circle" design.
The medium frame is the metal material, the bottom is symmetrical design and configuration of the TypeC data interface.
The future of the Portland smelter is fraught with uncertainty due to the cancellation of the power supply contract
As power companies powered by the plant revealed that a factory owner would terminate a supply contract, thereby invalidating all supply contracts, the Potteralco smelter in Victoria and hundreds of workers at the plant are now facing an uncertain future.
The move comes after the Victorian government decided not to continue the subsidies to guarantee factory operations.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will end in November.
The 2,000 workers at Alcoa's Portland plant may face unemployment.
As soon as the factory closes, up to 2,000 people may be unemployed directly or indirectly.
And because the plant's electricity consumption accounts for about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity output, there may also be a knock-on effect.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down the Hannity smelter, which led to the closure of the Angel Island power plant last year.
The Portland smelter is currently losing and is at risk of closure.
The move comes after a prediction of the plant's future years, initially due to the strength of the Australian dollar, and most recently because of the price of factory products.
AGL provides electricity to the large aluminum smelter through the Old Eyang power plant in La Trobe Valley, which predicts that three other factory owners will also end their agreement.
The biggest shareholder in the factory is a joint venture between an American aluminum company and alumina companies, while China's Citic Group and Japan's meatball company also hold small shares.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, meaning the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand," the joint venture said.
AGL said the contracts were "hedging contracts" that should have been in effect since November 2016.
The termination of the contract is 12 months, so they will end in 2017.
"So the AGL still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in the 2017 fiscal year," the power company said.
Any income impact on AGL from the 2018 fiscal year is now subject to an optimistic outlook for wholesale electricity prices in the futures market.
AGL said the company had reduced the contract value of $187 million in "termination activity expectations."
The company said its decision to terminate the contracts "would not affect the ability of Alcoa to run the smelter or guarantee the smelter's power supply."
The US company said it had signed a 20-year contract with old Eyang in 2010, which would have come into effect in November, but the company did not explain why it had withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle will be closed because of the bad economic situation in the industry.
In response to comments made by analysts earlier this week, AGL operating director Stephen Michelson said Portland's annual electricity consumption reached about 600 megawatts and the Tomogo plant reached about 900 megawatts.
If the two factories are closed, there will be a significant reduction in demand for the electricity market.
"As a power company, it's not good news for us," he said.
The Community Law Center turns 160,000 people away every year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups are turned away by community law centres every year, and funding for the service is already stretched and now faces further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three out of every five people are denied access to free legal advice and agency services, most of them elderly people, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, and people who do not have the resources to fight injustice.
The lack of funding for community legal services has long exceeded the limit and now faces further funding cuts.
Since June next year, the federal government's funding for these legal centres will be reduced by another 30%.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Law Center, said thousands of people were turned away every year, according to the latest National Community Association Law Center survey.
Mr Farrell said the situation would only get worse if the federal government did not change existing decisions.
"Queensland's community legal centre is chronically underfunded, meaning thousands will not be able to access the vital services needed," he said.
People who need to stay away from violence, people with huge debt that can't be repaid, families facing disintegration, squeezed workers, all face legal issues and the report shows they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut another 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable groups in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal issues without help.
We call on Justice Minister and Queensland MP George Brandyce to immediately withdraw the decision to cut funding so that people can get the help they need in the face of legal issues.
Last year, the state government promised to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
Attention must now be paid to the needs of community legal centres and their response communities, and the Whitehall government must also invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign team prosecuted for staff pulling guns
New York: Trump's campaign team has been sued for inaction after the head of its North California state pulled a gun to a staff member when driving a jeep in February.
Vincent Bodini, a former software trainer for the state's campaign team, described the incident in a state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Mr Bodini said he had previously hoped the matter could be resolved internally, but after waiting months he realised "it could not happen."
According to Bodini, the head of the name, Earl Philip, "pulled out a pistol, put his right index finger on the board and pointed the gun at Vincent's knee."
After complaining to the local and regional campaign team leadership, Bodini learned from the file that at least four more people had experienced the same thing.
"No shooting does not mean it doesn't cause harm," Bodini said in a complaint.
Just two days before the case, the Republican presidential nominee told the crowd in North Carolina that if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and picked up her favorite judge, then "those who support the Second Amendment," that is, gun holders and gun lovers may take action, a statement that sparked outrage.
Trump's campaign team said the media had taken his words out of context, and he did not advocate violence.
In his complaint, Bodini asked the campaign team to pay compensation for his lax oversight, while also asking Philip to compensate for his attacks, assault and mental injuries.
Trump spokesman Hooper Hicks did not immediately respond to the news.
Unable to contact Philip.
Philip left the campaign team in the near term, according to WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotte.
His consulting firm, Innocent Consulting Services, did not respond immediately.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign team has been controversial.
Both sides of the case are Bodini and Trump's presidential campaign company, 16-CS-14300, Mecklenburg County (Charlotte) High Court General Chamber.
Britain must pass the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our community, London and the country as a whole.
For me, it's Heathrow's charm, as in the 2012 London Olympics, we did everything we could to ensure that our countries and regions were able to benefit from these events.
The Olympics have benefited Stratford and the East End.
And we will benefit the region again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local community alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and get young people around the airport out of unemployment.
As before the 2012 London Games, some thought Heathrow's expansion was too large.
I was told that Britain would not be ready for the Olympics and that we would be humiliated in front of the world.
Doubts about the 2012 Olympics are wrong, and their doubts about the Heathrow project will prove to be wrong.
While there will always be barriers that need to be overcome, Heathrow is addressing each of the issues facing it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for most people, not a minority.
The expansion will create as many as 180,000 new jobs and bring 21 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a technology and jobs wealth around the airport and across the UK.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team that has completed 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment projects on time and within the budget, including the T 5 terminal for five consecutive years as the world's best airport terminal and the T 2 terminal between the world's busiest two runways.
Now they are ready to build a third runway with 16 billion pounds of private investment.
Britain successfully hosted the 2012 London Olympics, and I believe the Heathrow airport expansion project will also be a huge success.
It is a good time for us to pass the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, so that we can escort our future and create a technology and employment wealth that is proud of the UK as a whole.
Lord Paul Dalton is chairman of Heathrow Airport Board and former UK Treasury Business Counsellor
A woman killed herself and was killed on a Swiss highway
The victim lay on the highway at midnight.
The woman who tried to commit suicide was run over by multiple cars on the highway early Thursday morning, and police are now looking for witnesses.
The accident happened on the A 1 highway near Morday, Vaud, in the early hours of Thursday.
Vaud Police said a woman was "desperate" on the road late at night and was run over by multiple cars.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman whose behaviour was clearly suicidal. She was run over by multiple cars, including a van.
The woman died on the spot.
Police have revealed that multiple drivers have been investigated, but some of the drivers are still not confirmed. Police are now calling on them, as well as accident witnesses, to come forward for an investigation.
A criminal investigation, which is a regular process of such incidents, has been launched to the Geneva Tribune, a lawyer for the Geneva Tribune said.
But it is not yet known whether there will be drivers facing charges.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
"This will be determined by the prosecutor," Mr Hofschettel said.
According to the results of two other similar cases over the past five years, the pilot will not take responsibility.
Both cases were caused by people walking up the highway late at night, according to the newspaper, and the final verdict was that the pilot could not have expected that pedestrians would cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was charged with manslaughter on charges that in August 2014 she hit a man and killed him on the A 1 highway near Pyeena.
The court heard the 22-year-old victim crossed the road after drinking.
After the investigation, the judge said the policewoman's driving behaviour was completely legal at the time, and the man appeared on the road "entirely unexpected and unpredictable" and the policewoman called the emergency call afterwards.
Anyone who can provide information about the accident near Mohr Day on Thursday should dial 0216448346 or 0216444444 to contact the police.
NASA climate model: Venus is suitable for human habitation
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus is fit for human habitation.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Research Institute have developed a model that explores the past of Venus, which uses tools and algorithms that are very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether Venus, which is high-temperature, water-free and atmosphere-filled with carbon dioxide, once had an environment similar to the Earth.
Previously, scientists thought Venus's rotation speed was slower because its atmosphere was thicker.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thinner, Earth-like atmosphere, and the rotation speed was just as slow at the time.
The model can also show the early terrain of Venus.
Venus may have more dry areas than Earth, but there have been enough water and geographical changes to breed life and prevent rapid evaporation.
In the early days, the brightness of sunlight on Venus was 30% darker than the Earth's.
"In the model simulation of the Goddard Space Institute, Venus's slow rotation makes its side of the day for nearly two months," said Antonio del Jeanio, a scientist at Goddard Space Research Institute at a news conference.
It warms the surface and produces rain that can form thick clouds, with thick clouds blocking most of the sun's heat like an umbrella.
The result of the simulation is that the average climate temperature of Venus is actually a few degrees lower than it is now.
The Venus evolution simulated by the model is similar to that of previous planetary scientists.
Although there may have been life on Venus, Venus has been exposed to excessively high temperatures and ultraviolet rays over the course of billions of years.
The ocean on the planet evaporates and the water vapor is also burned by ultraviolet light.
With the escape of hydrogen, there is only a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and deadly greenhouse gas effects that form the Venus we know today.
The researchers published the simulation results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Newsletter.
Patrick Roy resigned as manager of the avalanche team
Patrick Roy, who resigned as head coach and vice president of the Colorado avalanche ice team on Thursday, said he had no say at the team's decision-making level.
Joe Savage, managing director of Colorado executive vice president, confirmed the news and said the club would immediately start looking for a new head coach.
"Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of the Colorado avalanche team with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I've been seriously thinking throughout the summer about how to improve the team and make it stronger.
To that end, the head coach and vice president's goal must be consistent with the club's goals.
He also has to have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
But for now, these conditions are not yet met.
Schiz hired Roy on May 23, 2013, and he thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Mr Savage said.
We thank him for his contribution to the club and hope he will be smooth in the future.
Roy was nominated as the best coach for the Jack Adams award league during his first season in 2013-14 to coach the avalanche team.
He helped the club get 112 points, ranked first in the middle division, but the Colorado team was eliminated by the Minnesota team in the first round of the playoffs and lost in the last two years with the playoffs.
In the 2015-16 season, the avalanche team scored 39-39 flat 4 negative and ended up losing the second foreign card qualification for the Western Grand League game by five points.
As the goalkeeper of the Hall of Fame, Roy has won four Stanley Cup and won two for the Montreal Canadian team and the avalanche team.
North Sea oil field workers stop strikes and continue negotiations
The chief negotiator said workers in the North Sea oil field stopped the strike on pay, and the parties to the dispute began a new round of negotiations.
There have been multiple strikes against Wood Group, an oil field service company, on the North Sea oil platform run by Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement, "Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process for the current dispute."
We will start early next week with multiple full-day meetings in the coming weeks to revisit these issues.
The union said its recent actions were aimed at protesting the highest possible 30% pay cut, which was the first time the union had taken the move in 25 years.
Wood Group has reduced compensation for North Sea contractors by about 9% this year due to market pressure.
Before the pay cut, the company reduced its pay for maritime contractors by 10% in 2014.
The company said a pay cut would help the company get through the slack in the market.
Shell has cut thousands of staff and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries because of the company's need to streamline its operations after merging with British energy company British Gas Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from falling crude oil prices and the UK's Brexit decision in June.
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to explore the biggest labor dispute in the North Sea generation.
The North Sea is crucial to the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that serves the majority rather than the minority," Dave said in the statement.
In 2016, spending on new North Sea projects is not expected to exceed $1.4 billion, while average project spending over the past five years has reached about $7 billion.
Kepler measured the rotation speed of star stars
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete star rotation speed.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster have different rotation speeds and the association of rotation cycles with the composition of the planet.
"We want to learn more about the relationship between stellar quality, age and even the history of our solar system by comparing our results with other clusters," said Luza Rebel, a research scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing Analysis at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
The Stonecutters are 445 light years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and have just reached adulthood.
They reached the highest rate of rotation in their lifetime.
At the highest rotation speed, these mature stars emit a lot of stellar winds.
When these stellar winds pass through the magnetic field of the star, they make a brake on the stars.
As the star age increases, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measured the rotation speed of stars by tracking the timing of recognizable star spots (like sunspots).
The latest rotation speed data sets show that larger stars rotate slower than smaller stars.
Rebel compared the star to the dancer, and the larger dancer was spinning slower than the smaller dancer.
"In the" ballet performance "of the Stonecutters, we found that stars with slower rotation tend to be of greater quality, and the fastest-spinning stars are often the lightest stars," Mr Rebel said.
Because of the proximity of the astrocytes, it can be used as an ideal universe laboratory for comparing star mass and rotation speed.
"The Star Wars group has laid the foundation for a two-way rotation theory model for young and elderly stars," Mr Rebel said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why the stars slow down their rotation speed and "put up their own shoes."
Rebel and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the rotation speed of the StoneStar group in three new papers, which will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
The head of the South Lake Park Water Management Section, Zheng Jianjun, said that the deepest depths of the south lake were more than 10 meters, and that people who did not understand the situation were likely to be at risk.
"Although the South Lake rescue team is very professional, it is hoped that the vast number of rowing visitors will be able to wear life jackets, do not do violations on the lake and play safely," Zheng Jianjun said.
Wai Tau Village has a unique marine environment, sitting in natural ecology and human ecology two major leisure tourism resources.
"But the individual owners who bought the parking spaces, fearing that it would affect their car rental prices, and also suspected that others had a private heart, had been behind the damage, causing the parking space to be put on hold."
There is still a lot of confusion about when the sweet potato is introduced by anyone.
In the current mainstream view, the introduction of sweet potatoes has three lines.
The most influential and spreading of the three routes introduced by sweet potato is that Chen Zhenlong was introduced into Fuzhou by the Philippines.
The Beijing Municipal Social Group Management Office will now carry out special checks on the use of uniform receipts for social groups.
Inspection is divided into unit self-check and key spot check.
According to the relevant head of the City Council, the scope of the inspection includes social groups that have received unified receipts for social group contributions from 2013 to 2015.
"The success of the Olympics is defined by people who share stories on social media," the Rio Organizing Committee said in its 2012 Olympic communication strategy.
From the coverage of this Olympic Games, the media has made great changes in the way of communication, product form, language style, news perspective and so on.
The International Olympic Committee and media practitioners around the world seem to be meeting this round of challenges.
On August 11, Everbright Securities H shares went into the final day. It was noted that the market response was flat on the previous two days. According to the plan, it would be listed in Hong Kong on August 18.
According to a domestic brokerage analyst, the East Securities in Hong Kong is not good, the capital management business is the East certificate director, compared with the Bank of China, Citic Securities and other bank brokerage, appear to be insufficient.
Experts point out that since this year, with the return of the securities market, a lot of brokerage performance has slipped, but after the company listed the situation to more look at the development of the company's own business, can not generalize.
After the new deal is introduced, Suzhou will become the first second-line city in the country to restart the purchase.
The second-line cities that introduced or are about to introduce market regulation policies are more than Suzhou, including Hefei, Nanjing and other cities.
Previously, Hefei had taken the lead in releasing the loan policy, and the bank would refuse to provide mortgage services for home buyers with two suites in Hefei and a set of housing loans.
