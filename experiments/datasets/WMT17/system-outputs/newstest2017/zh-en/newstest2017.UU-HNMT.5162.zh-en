Primary doctor strike: Calls for new labour action
The primary doctor representative called on the Union to approve new labour actions against new contract disputes.
The British Medical Association Primary Doctor Committee will require its members to support more labour actions in early September.
The Primary Doctors Commission said that the Ministers did not address the concerns of the contract.
Primary doctors and medical students voted in July to resist contract transactions with the British Medical Association.
Of the members of the voting , 58 per cent opposed the contractual transaction.
The president of the Primary Doctors Commission , Ellen McCort , indicated that the Government " consistently remained silent " for the issue of resistance to the contract on Thursday.
" In the light of this , the Executive Committee of the Primary Doctoral Commission has voted a new contract that rejected the proposed plan and calls for a renewed formal consultation on all concerns.
In response to the silence of the Government , the Executive Committee of the Primary Doctors Commission has formally requested the British Medical Association Council to convene a special session to approve a long-term plan aimed at starting the upgrading of labour action from early September.
The dispute has led to the primary doctor's involvement in six strikes this year , including the first comprehensive strike in the history of the British national health services.
Dr. Johann Malawana , leader of the British Medical Association , recommended by the British Medical Association , resigned after the resistance by the British Medical Association.
During the meeting before the voting of 54,000 primary doctors with medical students , he said that the transaction is good and should be accepted.
After the vote , Jeremy Hunt , Minister of Health , said that the contract would be enforced in the English personnel.
Russia and Turkey: " Cognization " ?
A gesture ended a crisis.
Russia's meeting with the Turkish leadership on Tuesday , shaking hands and declared the formal end of eight months of water and economic sanctions.
Nevertheless , when Fracky Purin Miring was meeting the President of Turkey in the hall of the Puter Peters , I have a strong feeling: This reconciliation is that Ankara wants to see.
Yes , both sides really hand.
However , even in accordance with the standards of Mr. Putin's always convergence , Vladimir Putin is only laughing and hardly expressed its enthusiasm.
According to reports , the five references to " good friends " Putin.
I remembered.
At the same time , his commitment to the relationship with Russia will return to the level of the crisis and even higher.
The next day , a newspaper wrote that Mr. Erdoğan did not seem to happen.
But I think his enthusiasm implies something contrary.
However , Mr. Putin's continuing attitude indicates nothing he forgot.
Indeed , the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement was the reason for the crisis: Turkey's shooting down a Russian warplane in Syria.
The reaction in Moscow was intense.
Mr. Vladimir Putin was heavily criticized against the incident and accused Ankara on the back of Moscow.
Attacks from so-called friends are more unacceptable.
The two sides are hard to re-establish real trust.
Russian polls have also reversed since November.
For months , the government-controlled media has conducted an alarming attack on Ankara.
Suddenly , Turks seem to be responsible for all things.
The most serious was the accusations from senior officials: Mr. Erdoğan's family profits from illegal oil trades in the Syrian area controlled by ISIS.
He has categorically denied it.
However , the news from St. Petersburg showed that it was time to see.
After all , the meeting is premise that Putin received an apology from Turkish President Erdogan.
Russia can announce it.
For Ankara , the benefits of the truce are obvious.
First , Erdoğan nearly removed after the failure of the coup d'état last month , so he needs all friends.
The ongoing terrorist attack has clearly resulted in a great strike.
There is an economic motive.
Russian sanctions were very significant to Turkey , in particular the annual charter services of millions of Russian tourists to Turkish coasts.
The figure has sharply fallen nearly 90%.
With the restoration of the flight , Russian travel agents and charter companies will be relieved.
They will welcome the tourists of the Mediterranean season.
National television even predicted this week that the price of fruits and vegetables will decline once this week predicted this week.
" Tourists went back , " a report of Moscow newspaper Vedemosito said.
For Moscow , the visit has additional political values.
Ankara is angry for the weak response of the Western world to the intention.
In addition , Ankara was keen to use the political chill and weaken the relationship between Turkey and the West.
Because of the failure of the coup d'état , the Russian leadership will receive an Ankara point.
Note that this is a kind of gift for Moscow , which has been more interesting to the regime.
Therefore , the meeting held in this glittered sea side palace enables Russia and Turkey to refuse and ill-treated countries that refuse to be abused by the Western world , an analyst described it as " really income.
However , despite public reconciliation , significant differences remain.
Syria is one of the key factors . Moscow's role in Syria is playing and fair , and Russia and Turkey support the opposite faction.
It is foreseeable that after a preliminary conversation of nearly three hours , the two presidents said at the conference that the topic had not been addressed.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the question of the differences between the two sides , and Putin stressed.
The two sides have not reached a clear consensus on how to differ in Syria.
The resumption of the dialogue between the two countries is certainly a good thing under the possible months of public hostility among the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve outside Scotland
According to the Chief Executive Officer of the Royal Bank of Scotland , the bank will bring to a logistics department.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve outside Scotland.
The Royal British Brand of Scotland was committed to its global ambition.
But eight years ago , it was necessary to accept assistance from then.
For that time , brand strategists use the RBS to protect other consumer financial brands.
The group has sponsored the international sporting events to spend millions of pounds in order to observe the six countries of rugby and Wimbletton Tennis Championship.
But the right practice is to make more country brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will use for Scottish customers , but will not reply.
In England and Wales , all references to Headquarters and securities exchanges will be replaced by the National Temple Bank.
The brand of Alster has been used in the Republic of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Autonomous Region.
There are also other more prominent smaller private bank brands , such as the Ministerial Bank , Adam & Co.
Mr. McCunne was interviewed in the visitor to the visitor of the customers and employees in Frences.
" The Royal Bank of Scotland will eventually become our investor brands and one of the employees' employees because we have become a bank with many brands , " he said.
Because the bank itself becomes an international brand , RBS is also a global brand.
At present , I would like to say that we no longer focus on global attention , and we have shifted its eyes to home.
Each brand represents differences in their industry , and our employees serve through different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has shown not to continue to sponsor the six championships; while enhancing the image of different brands in sports events.
The chief executive said: " It is time to be a multi-branding bank , because we have been exploring how to be a better service bank.
If we aim to be a big bank with many brands three years ago.
At present we focus on customer needs and I believe you have noticed these changes.
I think we can restart these brands and are now appropriate.
Through the successful occupation of the President at New York , 3,000
The two victories of New Market have helped to work 3,000 professions and he celebrated the champagne
Frankie Dettori obtained his 3,000 victory on Friday , Frankie Dettori.
The precipitation of the hands of the manager , John Gosden , was accompanied by two victories on the night , and there were 3,000 professions.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth landmark jockey in the field of place.
The first five respectively: Sir Gordon Richards (Gordon Richards), Doug Smith (Doug Smith), Peter (Lester Piggtot), Weider (Pat Eddery and Carson Willie Carson).
" It's very particularly special . " The three championship of the three championship at Ghyary wins.
I am very excited because my family is also on the field
I'm pleased with the achievements of himself in Newamit , because I started here 30 years ago.
This is not a large-scale Jockey Club , nor the Royal Essco Jockey , Royal Ascott , which is only an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 audiences.
I'm glad too humble.
After the winning of the winning , the president caused a cheer
In the field of accessibility , two jockeys have obtained this achievement , and they were the championship jockey Richard Johnson and Sir Anthony McCown , who had made over 4,300 victories in his record career.
Berker was the nine German championship with 4,493 victory in his career
Daiton is one of the best jockeys of the contemporary jockey , so his landmark achievement is not surprising , and the people who had achieved this prior to him.
He's fashionable and healthy , but really lets him stand out in the room.
He is a great equestrian ambassador , and his enthusiasm and charm has attracted a large number of fans for the years.
A few weeks ago , I said in Epsom and Dairot , I should have reached 6,000 victory if he is not just a weekend.
Seriously , Daiton is the best equestrian of the Britain for the thirty years.
His character , this is a good thing for British races , but he is also an incredible jockey.
Daiton celebrates this milestone in his landmark jump
From the jump to jumping and two decades , Daiton has been a typical representative of British place.
His career is generally roller coaster.
He gained a champion of a multiple competition , including the famous " seven streak " in 1996 at the Royal Ecoto Jockey Club in Britain , but he was also subjected to the crash , which was suspended by suspension.
Three years ago , when he returned to the competition after the end of the six-month period , he showed an alarming character advantage and finally returned to the peak , and gives those who were doubtful.
He may not do too long - he had said before he hoped that at least 50 years.
Russian President Vladimir Putin lifted the director of the Executive Office of the Executive Office
Russian President Vladimir Putin , unexpectedly lifted the position of Director of the Presidential Office of Sergei Ivanov.
Over the years , Mr. Ivanov has been a molecule of the core group of Mr. Putin.
The 63-year-old Ivanov is now appointed as the Special Representative on Environment and Traffic.
The Kremlin's statement said Mr. Vladimir Putin has " declared the position of Director of the Office of the Russian President of Ivanov , " but there was no reason.
The beginning of 2012 as Deputy of Mr. Ivanov's Deputy (Anton Vaino) was appointed to his appointment.
Mr. Vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn , Estonia's capital , in 1972 , graduated from the famous Moscow State Institute of International Relations , working in the Tokyo Embassy.
Later , he managed the draft president and government employees , the Kremlin website (using Russian).
After his appointment , he said to Mr. Putin , " Thank you for your trust.
I think the most important task of the Government is to support the drafting of laws and control directives.
Mr Putin told Russian television Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself requested to resign and recommend Mr. Vaino to take over.
Is such a smile convincing ?
Moscow feels unrelated to this.
For a long time , Sergei Ivanov has been one of Putin's most intimate assistants and has also worked with the Soviet Security Agency (KGB).
As a Chief of Staff , he was one of the most influential persons in the country.
At the national television meeting with President Vladimir Putin , both called the Officer's own request.
Despite the smile before the lens , almost no one convinced - especially in the parliamentary elections.
So this is the defeat of a power competition ?
It has not been known.
But the official statement - a sudden choice of an environmental policy that had been seen as a presidential candidate - attracted many suspicions.
The Kremlin's website quoted Mr. Ivanov's dialogue with Mr. Vladimir Putin , and said: " In the beginning of 2012 , I asked you to give me this difficult position , even the troubled position and four years.
" The result is that I have served as the Director of the President four years.
Mr. Ivanov holds this in December 2011.
He served as Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and is also the former member of the National Security Service.
In the late 1990s , when Mr. Vladimir Putin served as the Federal Security Service (FSB , predecessor , the National Security Service), Mr. Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.
After Mr. Putin took office , he also designated Mr. Ivanov one of the five of his trust.
The outside  think that Mr. Ivanov might be the President of the Russian Federation after the end of Mr. Putin's second term , because it was a violation of the Constitution.
But this position is ultimately attributable to another intimate assistant of Putin , Dmitry Medvedev.
Prior to the resumption of the President three and a half years , Mr. Putin served as Russian Prime Minister.

A resident of Banff discovered that the fish showed their own garden and then sent help.
Kevin Bain believes that the 75 fish could be the ell that was caught by a sea tornado.
Mr. Bain lived in about 500 metres from the sea , he issued a video on the strange scene at Periscope and hoped that someone can explain why these two inches of fish would appear.
The Quisley Bridge is now available to Fat
The 1.35 billion project plan is completed in May 2017
The engineers have connected the North Deck and Bridge of Queerinfery Crossing to the North Deck and the Bridge of Queerifery Crossing , which is to say that the bridge is today.
The project is close to completion , which is the first dragon bridge near the three bridges.
The bridge of this bridge in Fat is 600 metres and 30,000 metric tons.
It uses 10,000 metric tons of steel , 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 rose.
The 1.35 billion project plan is completed in May 2017.
The Minister of Economic Minister Brown (Keith Brown) visited the scene today and became one of the first to board the bridge.
" This is a historic moment in the construction of the Bridge Consider " he said.
We all have witnessed the engineering operations on such an ambitious project , with more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel in this part of bridge alone.
Despite the size and weight of the bridge , the dragon between high bridge and the deck needs fine homework and needs very precision.
In general , nearly 79 per cent of the total deck has been installed and the concrete deck of the last paragraph deck is pouring in Rosyth today , that is to say that all the decks are ready.
" Whether the bridge project , the first dragon is a major milestone , " said Michael Martin , Director of Construction of Cost Bridge.
In the case of this project , the dragon showed the front civil engineering.
After the installation of the last paragraph plate and connecting it to the expanded Bridge North Bridge Panel , it needs to complete the remaining gap of the north or approaching the land side.
The completion of the operation needs to southern 700 mm in the northern elevated bridge.
This is a huge homework and a very precise operation.
It is significant because of high bridging 222 metres and heavier approximately 6,000 metric tons , there is a need to pull about 3 per cent.
It's precise because the engineering team needs to ensure that deviations are very small , and only a few miles each.
It is gratifying that everything progresses well.
The woman's gymnastics championship
Forget pressure.
Forget hype.
Simone Biles is not affected by this.
It's full of energy in horse.
The balance is managed.
Free gymnastics amazing.
The whole is excellent.
Now , finally the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old United States gymnast athlete removed the almighty champion on Thursday and showed her talent in the gymnastics.
She was 12.198 single silver medal winner , the " Final Five " member of the " Final Five " (Aly Raisman) and a Bronze winner Mustafani (Aliya Mustafina).
Simon Barres from the United States conducted a balance performance on Thursday in the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil.
Bails helped the United States to achieve four coronalities in the Olympic gymnastics , and she won five medals at this Olympic Games , further confirming that she was this generation and the best gymnast.
When seeing the moment of the general total , Bails could not hold tears . She finally ended the long trip.
Bails therefore among the ranks of " decades of athletes " like Michael Phelps (Michael Phelps), they raise sports projects in their respective areas to new heights:
Bails has recently held hegemonic medals for 15 world championships , including ten gold medals , including 10 gold medals , and she trained hard working to achieve higher precision every day , and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said , " Bails is the best gymnast.
There is also a last game in Brazil , but the game is more than the competition between Bails and other gymnasts than between her own and huge expectations.
If Bails doesn't return to her family in the Dexc Splin State , it will be very disappointed.
The gold medal and silver for the artistic gymnastics final in the summer 2016 Olympic Games , held in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , organized by Rio de Janeiro , Brazil (Thursday).
Bails gave the first gold medal on Tuesday , giving the retired national team coach for a surprise thick ceremony.
Although Bails insisted that he had not planned the future in the process of occupying the throne of the champion , the fact is not entirely.
One of the paragraphs in the free operation of Bails , including her landmark construction , is the Latin music , and the music is often listening to only one street with the Rio Games.
This is no coincidence.
The girl discovered by the mother found by the mother who was coached by Amereman Boorman at a stadium on the ground.
Since the summer of 2013 , Bails has not failed in almighty games , and she will win as long as they want.
The two rotations of Mustafana rotated a slight illusion.
The defending world champion Bails of the two projects of the balance and free gymnastics.
The balance of her  was about 15.433 and the free operation was made at 15.933.
While waiting for the final score , Lesman was gently holding Bails , and when Bails learned that he had achieved a dream, suddenly left tears.
Lesman's performance is a little like a revenge for four years ago , when she was third , but lost to Mustafana in the Bureau.
But this time , the American joked the 22-year-old leader of Grandmother.
She kissed the crowd after the end of free gymnastics and declared return , but the return sometimes looks questionable.
Bails was 19 years old . From earlier this week , its message was transmitted on Twitter , and its life has been given a new meaning.
The six-year-old Mahad Brown , 6 years old in the body , spared the philadelphia shooting
Police said a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia , which was the second six-year-old child in the city this week.
The child's grandparents confirmed that the shooting child is Mahaj Brown.
They said that Brown's groin , legs , arms and abdomen have multiple gunshot wounds , but the children were awake in the medicine.
" He had been many crimes , and the little body was played by the bullet , " his grandmother Delores Melenzez said to TV.
I could not believe.
The boy was critical in the hospital and has accepted many operations.
His family told television telling television that the child is looking.
He would have begun to read the first grade at the local primary school.
Brown is one of the four people shoot in the Germantown area.
Other three other three people were 29 years old and 32 years old.
One of the 29-year-old victims was critical according to CBS Philesalja , and two other victims were stable.
Television said the child was found on the car before the child's victim with the 29-year-old victim.
The other two victims were not on the car and the police were investigating whether they were injured.
The investigators told CBS Phillaphela , looking like more than the gunman.
The site found a number of offensive weapons cartridges , which can be inferred that they use different offensive weapons.
It is no doubt that this is a continuous war.
There are shells on the sidewalks both sides of the street.
" Therefore , there are many armed personnel at that time , " said Anthony Ginaldi , Philadelphia Police Secretary.
The area has many houses and vehicles.
No arrest operation has not yet been implemented and the police were said to have recorded monitoring video.
On Tuesday , a six-year-old child (girl) had been played in the door of the West Oak Lane community.
She is now recovering and the police still hunt the suspect.
Why we need Simon , Gabriel and Laury
This is this evaluation of this year's women's ombudsman team for more than one.
First , since 1984 , I went to every summer Olympic Games , but the United States never dominated.
Second , the team has three excellent gymnastics - Simone Biles , Gabby Douglas , and Lauren Laurie Hernandez (Lauren Laurie Hernandez), who have been inspiring a number of coloured girls.
The composition of the team is proud of all , because inside includes the Jewish Arisman Riseman and Catholic Madison Kocain.
The team finally looked like the US.
It also consolidates the peak of black and Latino women in this movement.
Over the past four years , the leading gymnastics athletes have been African Americans.
Last year , Simon and Gabriel were first and second.
This is too bad.
At the previous Olympic Games , Gabriel Elerra " unexpectedly " became the Olympic champion , which hailed the US.
Today , the world will witness the three world champions Beil Bambors , Douglas and Larrendez Lynned , who deduced their conventional gymnastics.
On Thursday , Simon helped the United States to achieve four crowns in the women's individual project.
Her mate teammate Arisman had a silver medal.
We boarded the peak of this movement , but it is not the case in the United States gymnastics.
Simon , Gabrielle and Laury entered the Olympic team , like Ali and Madison.
They are " ultimate five groups " (Final Five) because the next Olympic general team will be composed of four gymnasts , which is the last year of Marta Karolyi.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive campaign , and the gymnasts are mainly trained in private gymnastics clubs and their parents need to pay training , facilities , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs (including coaches and gymnasts and family), and the cost list is also increasing.
Most of the gymnastics clubs are located in the rich suburbs of the industry.
All the training of gymnasts was completed in these clubs and is a long-term expense for the family of gymnasts.
Baisler's coach Amereman Boorman and the coach of Hernández's coach Maggie Haney since the two gymnasts began to teach them.
We must bring more affordable and more accessible gymnastics training to numerous young girls affected by Simon , Gabriel and Laury.
Twenty years ago , I created your own gymnastic foundation.
In my organization , we provide free and cheaper gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Spanish Americans), and cultivate national and even world champions.
In September , we will be expanded to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this learning opportunity and benefit from this great Olympic movement.
Gymnastics helps to develop the strength , flexibility and coordination of the body and help to develop work hard , self-disciplinary and commitment.
These can bring a benefit for a person's health , study and work.
Encouraged by this team , thousands of young girls will study gymnastics.
Participation in the movement is significant , especially for girls.
This is an exciting moment.
Thanks Simon , Ali , Laury , Gabriel and Madison , thank young girls that motivate so many different young girls to open to healthy , strong and successful.
Rejection of Jeremy Hunt proposed that the primary doctor scheduled for further strikes
The Ministers were initially wishing to end the changing dispute by accepting the amended contracts amended by the British Medical Association (BMA) officials , but there were 58 per cent of the primary doctors involved in voting.
In July , Mr. Hunte revealed that the contract was planned , said that the British National Medical Service System (NHS) is currently in the " vacuum " and slightly delayed the interests of staff and patients.
The new contract first refers to the revision of the primary doctor's all night and weekend working practices to improve the nursing of irregular working time.
Last night , Dr. Ellen McCort , Chairman of the BMA Primary Doctors Commission , said , " Primary doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , especially if it would exacerbate the current labour crisis or treat all doctors fairly . "
The first group of doctors signed a new contract only for eight weeks , and we need to make progress and less time.
BMA efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations , but everyone is not willing to participate , and sometimes the government is silent.
Still , last month we got the commitment of Jeremy Hunter , he said his door was open.
" Jerry Henry now needs action to cancel enforcement and solve the primary doctor's fear.
If he does not do so , the primary doctor clearly said they had been ready to take further labour action.
The last strike occurred at the end of April , resulting in approximately 13,000 conventional operations and 100,000 appointments because nurses and consultative doctors played cover for the doctors on the picket.
The Ministers had initially wished to end the changing dispute through the amendment of BMA.
BMA hopes to seek better weekend wages for 54,000 primary doctors covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer , chief executive of NHS Employem , appealed to primary doctors to do nothing again.
Mr. Mortimer said: " Labour action is little effective and contrary to pressure on the already full teams and services , leading to the fear , concern and confusion of patients , care and their families . "
Over the past two months , we continue to negotiate with the Primary Doctors Committee and respond actively with the Ministry of Health and other departments to their concerns about their roles and reports.
Employers wish to continue to actively explore other important topics , such as the flexibility of deployment , training flexibility , other training , training costs and gender wage differences in the areas of common cognition for the course outline and the outline of the curriculum , the health education organization (Health Education England) and the Ministry of Health to agreement with BMA.
Pound 2 pounds per day reduce the threat of heart attack
The relevant officials suggested that pound 2 pounds each day be promoted to more patients and to extend the time of medicine , and thousands of heart patients will benefit from this drug.
The replacement of the corruption can reduce the risk of heart disease in the heart patients.
This drug continues to take 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or heart attack.
The National Health and Clinical Optimization Institute of the National Medical Services System (NHS) suggested that patients sustain four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
But now , NICE recommended that patients continue to medicate four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
In England , approximately 140,000 people have heart disease every year , of which a quarter will continue to experience a relapse or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are the plaque formation of fatty substances in the arteries.
If the plaque is disconnected , it will lead to thrombosis , thereby impeding blood flow to the heart and leads to a heart attack.
If the thrombus moves , it will enter the blood flow , impeding blood flows to the brain and leads to stroke.
Patients with a heart attack have been experienced , and heart attacks are higher.
Kagler was manufactured by the British company Astra Astreza , which was sales for the commodity , which can reduce pathogenic risks by reducing thrombosis.
The NICE guidance published today recommends that the patients take 90 mg to 12 months , and the three years after the three years take the ray and two aspirin.
" Despite the effective secondary prevention treatment , professor Carole Longson , Director of the NICE health and technical assessment centre , said , " There are more than a quarter of patients with history of heart disease will occur again or stroke and often cause serious consequences.
The fear of relapse would have a great negative impact on the quality of a person.
The evidence shows that the risk of heart disease and stroke is effectively reduced with aspirin.
The temporary recommendation for Kagler will provide more treatment choices for thousands of beneficiaries.
The draft guidance does not recommend the continued use of its treatment following this time limit because of the limited effectiveness and safety of Kagler after three years.
Computer culture makes the " electoral fraud " prevailing Muslim area
The former mayor of Tower Hamles , Lutfur Rahman , was dismissed last year and prompted a government report.
The " political correctness " culture led to the prevalence of electoral fraud in the Muslim community , which has been reported today.
The former Cabinet Minister Eric Pickles , Sir Eric Pickles , accused the police , the election of regulators and the municipalities as a result of " excessive sensitivity to ethnic division and religious problems ".
The minister of community affairs , and the current anti-corruption hand , said that the practice of intimidating voters in religious positions should be admitted and that the police should be authorized to establish a cordon outside the polling station to protect the heart of the voters.
He recommended that the voters be carrying identification documents to confirm their identity.
At present , voters need only offer their names and addresses.
The report even suggests that the ink of the voter fingers prevented the secondary vote.
Sir Eric said they should increase the protection of whistle-blowers.
He called for an increase in the media's understanding of the meeting documentation and ways of decisions taken by non-official committees or working groups.
" This is not just to prevent electoral fraud and to protect local governments from a widespread culture of corruption and financial fraud that is closely linked , " he said.
The report is the request of Downing Street after the election scandal of Tower Hamles in London East.
Last year , a special electoral court ruled that there were a series of corruption and violations in the country's law.
The Tribunal found that Rahman " very ridicusing " the religious feelings of the Muslim community and discusses the allegations of his sword and Islamophobia.
It was said that Rahman " at the election campaign " claimed to vote as a religious obligation of loyal Muslims.
Up to 300 ballot papers may be a vote of others.
Sir Eric said there is evidence that there is an electoral fraud in the country.
He specifically warned the election of elections , and the senior members of the Muslim community were said to exert pressure on voters and forced those voters to vote to them.
Sir Eric (in the photograph) gives multiple recommendations on the mechanism for clearance , including their identity to confirm their identity
In his report , he said: " The evidence indicates that senior members of senior members , particularly in background communities in Pakistan and Bangladesh , to exert pressure on vulnerable groups , especially women and young people , to vote according to their will.
" Because of the excessive sensitivity of ethnicity and religion' political correctness , they are concerned that national institutions will be a blind eye.
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals for cleaning up the electoral mechanism , including the prohibition of political activists to deal with the postal voting paper to prevent the " voting gains ".
The report also requires severe registration information to prevent the roster of voters for immigration and welfare fraud.
These recommendations include requesting voters to produce identity documents before the vote.
After the voters applying the ink on voter fingers , prevent the second vote.
Systematic verification of the voters' nationalities to ensure the vote.
The effective period of automatic postal voting request is three years.
Political activists and radicals deal with the completed mailing voting and post vote envelope.
Authorize the police to establish a picket around the polling station.
The amendment of legal provisions would enable more easily to accuse the persons concerned in accordance with the 1983 People's Representative Act (Representative of the People Act 1983).
The photograph of the polling station is illegal.
The polling station may be used only in English (except in the Welsh region).
Strengthen training to ensure strict implementation of the " separate voters ".
Sir Eric denounced the Metropolitan police station , saying that they did not propose any criminal allegations after the Tower Hamles event.
" Rahman and his Electoral Officer have a number of corruption and violations and therefore suffered from the eligibility court's disposition , " he said.
In accordance with the criminal standard , he is guilty in many ways.
He also criticized the " checking box " to the election registration department of the city hall.
Sir Eric said , " Last year's court last year to the Tower Hamles sounded the wake of the call . "
Our country has a glorious tradition of " the mother of Parliament " , but some institutions in private secretly election fraud and things are really worrying and threatened.
The Rio Games looks like Kate's carriage and other famous celebrities in the Rio Games

How to protect themselves in gun attacks
The world is very dangerous , but this video on Dairymally may bring you secure.
We consulted Rhon Mizarchi , Master Krav Maga Federation , in New York , to understand how to respond to a gun.
Whether he is from the front or behind you , the video will teach you how to do.
If the gunmen is close to you from behind you , you want to turn so that you can see the attackers and " clean the fire ".
Then , using the forearm and shoulders , then hit your face with your elbow.
When the attackers bent down because of their pain , the attacker reversed his gun and played his face with the barrel and a backup gun.
If the gunmen is close to the front , a similar skill - let your body is not within the field line , take guns and reverse gunpoint so that gunmen cannot fire.
At the same time , weight on the gun and hit the attacker's chest and reversed the gunpoint from his hands and then target him.
Sounds complex ?
Look at the video to see what Mizrachi does.
But please remember that if you're not the master of Magara , the most secure way is to surrender cash.

China's Mars Plan
My country's Mars Detection Task should achieve a surrounding , landing and tour , which is never from abroad.
My country's Mars Detection Launch Target is to think about a step surrounding , landing and inspecting the task.
Since Mars explores 26 months to encounter a time window , experts are closely developing engineering programmes to seek the first fire detector of our country in 2020.
According to the presentation , although my country's aircraft has entered the deep space , it is still indispensable for the completion of Mars' detection tasks , and the detection of Mars means China enters the deep space detection era.
" Once every two or three years , there is one recent opportunity for the Earth to launch a Martian detector at this time , the most provincial energy for launch vehicles.
" Taking into account the quality of the Mars detector , the launch rocket will be completed by our Long March 5.
My country's Mars Detection mission should achieve a surrounding , landing and inspection , which is never from abroad , but the landing failed.
The technical areas involved in Mars are very high , in particular that , although the fire is a spatial detector , it has a stark characteristic than the general space detector.
That is , the detector should have the ability to determine the driving route and discover barriers.
China's space science and technology group researchers said that human beings are so popular about Mars detection because of the important scientific and technical significance of Mars , even relating to the future of humanity.
At present Mars has become the highest planet with the highest levels of human research outside the Earth , and the history of human use of space detectors to detect almost the whole human history.
Therefore , mankind hopes to establish living bases in Mars , eventually to Mars immigrants into the second home of mankind.
A large number of indications also suggest that Mars was likely to be like the current Earth , only through billions of years of evolution into thin , low temperature and depletion of water.
Therefore , research on the detection or manned landing of Mars can be planned to prevent the earth's second Mars to survive.
As of June 2016 , there were 114 moon detection , 43 Mars Detection.
However , from the 1990s , human beings have conducted 18 Mars detection , while the moon detects only 14.
At present , there are five Mars orbiters and two Mars vehicles to work , but only one lunar orbiter and one moon lander is working.
The world's space countries have developed a detection plan for the Mars system , which is seen that today's Mars detection is hot than the moon.
On 5 November 2013 , India launched the first Mars Detector " Mangarian " and became the first country in Asia to detect Mars.
" Mangarian " is used to study the surface , atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars and explore whether there are methane and signs of life on Mars.
The most difficult place in this task is the only opportunity to decelerate after the detector into the Mars atmosphere
Mars detection task is faced with many technological challenges , according to the Chinese Space Science and Technology Group.
The Mars atmospheric pressure is very low and only 1 per cent of the earth's surface is high.
Scientists haven't got a thorough understanding of its change and storm time.
Mars frequently forms dust storms similar to the Earth's dust weather , which would lead to a sharp decline in the sunlight energy received by the stars , which must be designed to design a " dormant " model to make it patiently wait for dust storms.
At the same time , the Mars Atmosphere has a cutting role in the sun light , which brings problems for the energy supply of Mars.
This requires a greater area of the detector's wing , and it needs to be adjusted and efforts to direct the sun.
Also , the surface of Mars is only 38 per cent of the earth , but most of the gravity of the surface of the moon , so the detector needs greater power.
" The most central and most difficult place in the Mars Detection Task is the process of detecting the process of access to the atmosphere in the Mars atmosphere and the parachute slowdown in the Mars atmosphere , only one chance to ensure success.
Because of the distance of the Earth and Mars , the whole process could not be controlled by the ground , so the detector must be completed.
Because of the absence of so many propellants to offset the high speed , it is difficult to simulate the Mars atmosphere when landing on Mars.
In general , the mode of detecting Mars is similar to the detection of the moon , and is " around , fall , patrol , return " and ultimately realizes the goal of Mars.
Since Mars is far from the Earth than the moon , the detection of Mars needs to tackle a series of more complex technology.

Although not confirmed , many sources said that apples will be held in September 2016.
Although Apple has not responded , the functions and configurations of the new iPhone have already been released , even the Internet's " true model " image.
The new generation of iPhones can be " associated " , hot , hard and money . If you want to buy for the first time , it must choose a good channel , such as Sunin.
This has exacerbated people's disappointment for the new phone , " it's extended , but it cannot project holographic images ! This generation of iPhones was bad.
It is accompanied by numerous secrets , like other iPhones.
In addition , there are many sources claiming that the new generation of iPhones will cancel three 5mm headphone interfaces to use Bluetooth connection and charging interfaces , which will provide space for apples to increase the second speaker.
Another evidence of supporting the news is that apples in 2014 allow headphone producers to produce headphone products through the charging interface.
These messages or real or leave , and the answers until Apple's 2016 fall conference can be announced.
But this is without prejudice to the prospects for the industry's inhabitants - many believe that the iPhone will be likely to be an apple's last escalation of the iPhone series.
Although the iPhone's market share has fallen from the recent market research institution.
Among them , Goldman Sachs maintains " buying " ratings , while BMO's analysts think that iPhone will harvest a historic result.
At the same time the CEO of Borton's CEO Hock Tan also says that the future revenue increases in the future would be likely to more than 20 per cent , which was fully benefited from the introduction of the iPhone.
Seven percent of the respondents said they had their intention to purchase the iPhone , while the number of people planned two years ago to purchase only 4 per cent.
It is understood that there are 20 per cent of the user group holding iPhone's or 6Plus plans to purchase the iPhone.
Secondly , an expert analyzed that most of the powders like to replace their own iPhone.
According to statistics , approximately 26 per cent of users in all iPhone users have not replaced their phones two years , and almost 120 million users were used for two years.
According to the media , Taiwan encountered several earthquakes during physical production , " the bad degradation of electrical production facilities beyond imagination and may have an impact on the initial IPhone supply.
Supply and demand contradicts affect the ordinary user , it is time to choose a good channel , and the first time is incorporated in the hands.
According to people familiar with the situation , the Sunin senior and Apple have frequently met with Apple in order to prepare for adequate supply.
Operators have been settled with Sunin and can be foreseen that with the depth cooperation of both sides , it is necessary to bring a lower price for users and service.
" At the lowest price , consumers may be able to purchase the iPhone . "
Sufficient supply and diversified preferences , let the purchasing point is not " pressure mountains " , while Sunin's logistics will become more intuitive.
Perhaps , you'll receive the phone at midnight , " You , Sunin , your iPhone.

On the morning of 12 August , the Office of the State Council held a press conference on the national economy in July 2016.
The national statistical statistics spokesman and the Director of the Integrated Statistics Division of the National Economy said that in July , the national economy part of the national economy has slowed , but it is still operational.
The data issued by the National Statistical Office showed that fixed asset investment growth and total imports have fallen.
With regard to the functioning of the national economy in July , I would like to borrow the words that the Prime Minister had said " waveling and still good " , which can compare the features of economic operation in July.
He explained that " tangible fluctuation " is that the growth of economic indicators in the month of January is indeed fall.
Since the international economy is still in depth adjustment in July , the international situation is complex and changeable , the recovery of the world economy and expectations , so export pressures are more large.
From the domestic circumstances , the entire economy is also at the critical stage of adjustment , the pain of adjustment is released and the economy is not facing downward pressures , so some indicators are fluctuated.
It was pointed out that there was a special circumstance in July , where the flood disasters are more serious and the heat summer weather has a number of influence on production operations in some areas.
According to the recent information published by the Ministry of Civil Affairs , more than 60 million people in the country were affected by direct economic losses of over $ 200bn.
From industry , investment and transport related indicators , the differences in these areas are affected.
The growth rate of goods in July was 3.6 percentage points than last month , and the flood disasters have a certain impact on traffic in these areas.
From these factors , part of the indicators in July are also normal and are expected.
" The power is still good " refers to the economic growth rate , but economic operations are generally smooth and there is no change.
CPI increased by 1.8 per cent in July , rising 0.2 per cent in the ring comparison; and the price situation is generally stable.
According to the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau's network statistics on high temperature weather in the district counties , the rest of my city receives different high temperature allowances.
At least 28 provinces in the country have clearly clarified the standards for the issuance of allowances , although the standards issued by provincial municipalities are not the same , while Chongqing is receiving high temperature allowances according to high-temperature working days.
Over 35 ° C is not less than 10 yuan per person; over 37 ° C is not less than 15 yuan per day.
More than 20 yuan / day benefits for above the high temperature staff members of the high temperature (except in accordance with the law).
In accordance with this criterion , the largest number of days of high temperature weather can be received 330 yuan , while the least city of the number of days was 80 yuan , while the most high temperatures of the province were not high temperature.
In the past , a number of units will offset high temperature allowances in drilling collections , and the Municipal Authority indicated that such practices are not existing.
With high temperature weather stopping work and shortening working hours , units shall not deduct or reduce the wages of workers.
The Municipal Community said employees have encountered high temperature operations without receiving high temperature allowances , which can seek the legitimate rights and interests of the labour dispute mediation institution where they are located , or call 12333 complaints.
The workers may complain to the competent department of social security for human resources at or above the county level where the use of human resources may complain to the competent department of human resources at or above the county level.
At the same time , the high temperature allowance is part of wages , not benefits , incorporating total wages and deducting taxes.
Therefore the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage and must be issued in the form of cash and cannot be replaced with in kind.

That is to say , all vehicles and 30 trains can be parked in Urumuzi.
Now two stations can buy tickets , and the train between them is about 10 minutes , and the passengers need to pay attention to the specific name of the par visit and terminal.
The official input of the new station of Urumqi will be an important platform for the creation of a national integrated transportation city , promoting the " Silk Road Economy " and New Areas.
Greecia is a germ female bird , and the breath of the tropical forest.
In Central American countries , Greecia and its stories have been household.
At a press conference on 10 August , Gracia , who recovered after operation , finally appeared to demonstrate its new 3D printed plastic beak.
This was only a year and a half ago before beaking and dying birds , and finally heavily received.
This day not only declares its 100% restored health , but it moves into luxury birds and meets with human friends in it.
Gracia in the early new house was slightly shy , but it becomes lively up and wallowed in the basin , with new beaks.
In order to remind people that had been suffered , the technical personnel did not paint its new beak , but retained the white of 3D printing.
Beak is a thin layer of sheating , inside , only some careful bone power.
Although this internal reinforcement ingredient , the big bird beak or fragility is fragmented when injured.
Animal assistance centres , birds and an American 3D print company work together to produce several " beak beaks " for Greecia and finally made the " perfect beak " that fit it.
Today , Greecia has been able to use new beaks to drink water , eat , even pecking a little grain.
The design of the final product spent about two months and printed only four and five hours.
" 3D printing is not a future technology , and it's really walking into your life . " In an interview with Xinhua International Journalists , the chairman of the American company GD.
In January 2015 , a farm in Greecia , Central Costa Rica , was found to be found.
At that time its beauty was discouraged by a group of young people , and it is completely impossible to eat and life is dying.
Following the media coverage , the horror of Greecia was reported by media reports in Costa Rica and within and outside Costa Rica's call for animal abuse.
There is a request for more stringent animal protection laws and increases the punishment of the abuser.
People are spontaneous and do their best efforts to help Greecia restore life before injury.
Even the inventor of the 3D printing technology is also involved in the design of Greecia.
" Gracia's situation is very special and its remaining part of the beak is less than 1 cm , so it brings many difficulties to install new beaks.
" We were scanning first and designed and produced a slightly longer group longer than it's remaining part of it . "
" This can reduce further intrusive injury to Greecia , " Lang said to Xinhua International Reporter.
Before the installation of prosthetics , the staff member should clean the beak in Greecia every day to prevent infection.
Far more than thousands of thousands , the story of Greecia is moved by the famous documentary director Paula Mareda and the exploration of the producer of news channels.
They recorded the installation of new bills in Greecia , recording a documentary Documentary Country , which was played on animal planet channels this month.
The Documentary's Documentary Country showed that a small giant bird is how to change a country for changing and involving nationals in opposition to abuse.
Core prompt: Japanese oil is particularly vigilant of the rise of Chinese small independent refiners called the teapot.
" China's export expansion is one of the reasons why China's export is one of the reasons for the downturn in China's expansion ,' said Japan's largest petroleum enterprise.
Japanese oil is particularly vigilant of the rise of Chinese small independent refiners called the teapot.
China's petroleum product quality is gradually close to Japan's protection.
Prior to access to crude oil import license , the " teapot refinery " is generally refined from Russia to import heavy oil in high sulphur content.
The sulphur content of oil products produced is one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After acquiring crude oil import license , the " teapot refinery " can import the import of Amand crude oil and Russian crude oil and the quality of their oil products has also been promoted.
" As China's domestic petroleum product quality standards continue to improve , the ability of refinery equipment has also been promoted.
As a result , the quality of Chinese external exports is gradually reaching the same level in Japan (the highest quality of the world).
JX said , " after the end of 2015 , China began to export high-quality oil to Australia " to compete with Japanese products in Asian markets.
Although " Japanese high oil " is facing the crisis , Japan's oil enterprise takes the response strategy only for " attention to market prices " to export profit markets.
As China's exports of petroleum products affect the market in Asia , it is also increasingly high on the teapot refinery.

In some nights , the ionosphere is full of free electronics , which means that radio signals can be more far.
The American air force is interested in replicating this effect on August 11.
Although a stable large number of free electronic ionospheres can help people listen to the station at the edge of a university radio station , this may not be the interest of the American air force.
The electronic ionosphere means that the radio used by the military has greater broadcasting , and it might provide some protection for the global positioning system (GPS) signals from the solar storm.
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of cube satellites based on requirements that can strengthen the ionosphere at the time of need.
But first , these teams that sign contracts with the Air Force must prove that the scientific principles work.
Industry data show that coal capacity in 2015 is close to 6 billion tons in 2015 and 1.8 billion tons of coal capacity in country.
For the past 10 years , the State Council has issued five notifications of excess and backward capacity.
Although the previous four times did not target the coal industry , the target industry has a direct relationship with coal.
Last November between November and January this year , Qinhuan Island's 5,500 major capacity prices were long at 370 yuan / tonnes , and 90 per cent of coal enterprises were losing losses.
Since February , the coal prices have progressively rebounded , and the immediate rise in power coal prices in quite recently increased to 16 months , rising to 436 yuan per ton , rising nearly 70 yuan.
With the recovery of prices , worries about the following: A group of small coal mines will not return to the return ?
This is the analysis and interpretation of the Director of Reform Development Academy of China (Hainan).
Cleaning: Production can give rise to the high concern of the parties , and the transcript of capacity in the coal industry today also feels concerned.
The factors of these three surfaces are reflecting the reason for the relative lag in our growth pattern , which has not been fundamentally shifted by government-led growth.
Secondly , this is also directly related to the advancement of local governments and , in the process of production , funds and corresponding accompanying measures are in place , from which the difference in different regions is indeed relatively large.
Thirdly , if some provinces that are currently slow , they might face greater risks.
In these circumstances , the process that relies on central awards to produce capacity may have a negative impact.
First , the production is not a simple total control.
Our purpose is to promote the optimization of the structure by eliminating backward capacity , refactoring the new economy in the coal industry.
In the process of deployment to capacity , local governments must combine the transition escalation of capacity and the coal industry to develop related services.
Secondly , we would like to fulfill the strength of administrative supervision and administrative supervision in this year.
Finally , we will strengthen social security.
Since the market is directly involved in employment , we will strengthen the training of employees and workers' employment skills.

The traditional year's method usually uses animal calcification organizations , and some sharks can use the ridges , but this calcification organization is scarce in the Greenland shark.

In 14 years of sports career , the 18 world championship became the first person to won four Olympic gold medals in the Chinese Games.
She ranked the world's first consecutive year for eight years and was the longest of the world's first time.
On 26 September 2010 , the Under-Secretary-General of the Under-Secretary-General and General Manager of the People's Search Network Corporation , Cadre of Office.
She will work together to create the first domestic sports industry innovative entrepreneurial platform.
The Chinese forum also has such a group of star coaches: They were unlimited in the athletes' times , winning numerous glories for the country; they will be decommissioned for many years and train the champion.
As Chinese men's gymnastics first world championship , you chose to pick up the whip.
From the women's coach to the male coach , again to the total coach , Yang Yun built a " Olympic gold mission " and a more rate of 9 gold 1 silver copper.
Thereafter , there was an important role in recent years.
Many NBA players have demonstrated their strength . But there are progress to decline.
Whether because of the increase of age or appearance time , there are some players every season.
Of course , some " regression " may be just the shrinking of data , which may not decline.
Even Wade remains one of the best score guards in the coalition , but he should not have the heat in the bull.
He constituted a limited range of limited ranges and three points in the station star Butler had only 32.8 per cent , which makes their next season attack.
With the city , the electrical engagement is bound to make the ball more to Butler and Londo , which is likely to choose a healthy play in the regular season.
Okae's situation is comparatively embarrassed as the first choice of 76 persons in the season , he had to compete with Simmons and Ebidby in the new season.
This competition may not be coming quickly , and Simmons needs to adapt to the NBA competition , and Ebidby would have to be fully recovered as soon as possible , but it would be a problem in 76 people.
Over the last season , the 32 per cent scoring from the low attack , which is higher than that of Koschins , Vuchevic and Broper Lopes , while his utilization is also 40.
As Simons has demonstrated the excellent ball forward potential , Ebidby has a figure more suitable for the NBA competition.
Over the past two seasons , Thompson's utilization has been stable before the coalition , which is the best two seasons his career.
The problem , however , is that with the arrival of Durant , Thompson's utilization will certainly decline , which will affect him.
This impact would not only be the impact of the number of times , and Tong's ball offensive will also reduce the next season , which will reduce his opponent's defensive defense.
The arrival of Durant will make the team's players' data shrink , but this is the most serious thing is Tom.
But that doesn't mean that the level of Tong's level is more like he sacrificed for the team.
Parker was better than data reflected in the last season , not only because of the highest efficiency of his basket and the chemical reaction of his and Alderi has also benefited the team.
Duncan was decommissioned by Duncan announcing another year again , and GDP combination ultimately comes to the end , as one of the youngest in three people , with no oil in the French sports car.
After having received the third general ring , only Jabal , Jordan and Lasser had won more regular MVP and Jordan is the only FMVP more than James.
Oh , and James has just brought Cleveland to the first occupational sports trophy in the last 52 years.
James in the 14th season of the career needs better assurance and ready for the playoffs.
Therefore , in the regular season , James's data is likely to further decline , and he would distribute more burdens to Owen , but he would still be three players of the alliance.

The United States received a silver medal in the seven people on the olive ball , and Fijian won a gold
In the seven people on Thursday night , the United States haven't been able to continue in front of Fiji's first performance , which was defeated by the Fijian territory at the Rioti Odoro stadium.
This is the first Olympic medal since the history of the first Olympic medal since the history of the country.
The silver medal is a no small consolation for the defeated English country , which is a third silver of the British delegation that day , which was sufficient to make the British olive team with pride: They defeated New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa for the first time into the Games.
Earlier that day , the United States may affect their state in the final earlier.
But , in any case , the now Fijian is sufficient to beat a spiritual 15 team.
Tomorrow , at least one Englishman will wear a gold medal , which may be a comfort for the United States , but it might not be a kind of comfort , but it might not be that the British was the main coach of the Fijian coach from Wimbletton , and he served as the main coach of the English.
It is not easy to achieve today.
Eight years ago , under the teach of Ryan , they did not taste fruit on the seven people of the seven people in Adler.
Now , they're only a step from the champion.
Although they had been subjected to a huge strike , there were alarming progress.
Fiji's opening occupied an advantage to make the English country without parallel.
For Michel Tom and his teammates , this was like a series of buses that are being driving , and when the World Series championship has been far from the score of 5 than 0.
The competition was only four minutes , and Jerry Thuan was the right.
In 12 than 0, the United States almost never touched the ball.
Mitchell's strong interdiction allows the giant to generally not score the third time , but it was just the speed of Fiji.
On seven minutes , the country in the right corner . The English country worses.
The game was one point and the game.
Then there was a break of the defense of the English country until the line.
When the midfield rest , the score is 29.
Fijians seem to be born with seven olive rugby , and the United States are still initial.
This is this.
The United States have made significant changes in the second half and shocked Fijian defenses in the first four minutes , and this is already good in the first half of the first session , but after which the Fijian cooperation has been working again by Joshua Tuto.
Dr. Nonton has created an opportunity to score for the English country , which had been touched in the left corner and replaced the score more to 36 than 7 , but the game has been controlled by the South China Sea island , and their fans sing on the platform , waving flags and song dancing.
The wonderful performance of Fiji's wonderful performance has to handle the clap.
Mary William stopped one of the indifferent attacks in Fiji.
The final whistle sounded , Fijians hugged together and the finished United States can only regret.
Earlier that day , Fiji defeated the Japanese team in the semi-final , while Britain was overwhelming in a fierce semi-final risk.
The first half helped the South African southern to achieve the lead , but Non Dannon broke down in the second half.
Afterwards , England Anthony's brother Marcos ensured the team's victory with a wonderful interception.
Gran Haller and Heather Tanning were encouraged by coaches with cancer and won the gold medal
It is no exaggeration that this is the most moved gold medal.
From the first paddle to now , Gran Haller and Heather Staninn have accepted 220 punitive training trainings , while their gold medal in Estacio da Lagoa was more extraordinary.
Although there are only two of them , there was a person on the ship - the voice of coach Coach Robins William - has been accompanying their second consecutive woman's oar of the Olympic gold medal , which is the first to achieve this high level.
They have maintained 39 records with absolute advantages.
What we see is the elegance of the two genius athletes on the water , but it is not all of this victory.
There are many volunteers behind every rowing gold medal , which is their continuous dedication , which helped the biggest than a 30-month learning that they were suffering from cancer and doesn't know whether I can see this day.
As he said , death may be coming.
I have developed bladder cancer , and they did the surgery for me.
If you don't do surgery , cancer cells will expand them.
In this way , the situation is bad.
This will slightly change your view.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 as cancer.
Fortunately , he started treatment at the beginning of 2014 to minimize the impact , although it may not be appropriate in this case.
I need to get wages , so I have to get up.
This is an inspiration for me.
I lived in the hospital , although they said steps are sufficient , but I went to 20 feet , 30 feet and 50 feet every time.
This is everything.
The rowing movement itself is a journey , which makes this journey longer.
At that moment of gold , they thought first thought that Williams was Williams . This morning Williams' Williams was slightly talkative as to overcome his anxiety.
After Stanin , the Royal Military Commissioner , she said , " I'm not good for this week , possibly a little extreme , but the gold medal is indeed meaning.
It repeatedly tells me that this is much important for me , and I , Helen and Robin had paid much efforts.
This is Helen , Robin and I worked for three years.
If we don't have Robin , we're only unknown and thanks for him , and he is the best coach of the world.
I can't find than his better trainer and coach.
Gran Haller and Jean Staning never failed in five years.
The punishment set for the combination is that their opponents are not compared.
Even in the last 500 metres , the New Zealand and Danish were beginning to look forward that Stanin and Grave still had a lot of physical reserves.
At that time it's true.
Helen said: " Keep rhythm and keep the rhythm ".
It's very important to not be affected by opponents.
We have a good beginning , and we don't look forward to the big things that do.
We don't think of today's glory , and we just want to plan each oar and win this game and we do.
This takes a year to determine their own future.
Grave will marry the television history in the next month.
But now , she wanted to enjoy it.
I don't want to say this is my last game.
This will give me too big pressure.
In London I used about six months to realize that I am the Olympic champion.
This is a new experience , and I feel very nervous.
Now four minutes have passed.
She said I feel more.

The " animation " of Snaphact is satisfactory in Asian
Snaphatca says the inspiration of the filter is coming from animation , but some observers thought it was racial.
The 150 million daily users of Snaphact can change the reality through their filter tools and become laughed.
You can transform yourself into a pineapple , a dog or a role in the Lightenis.
These lenses have the effect of passivation and bending characteristics and produce more than 30 million passing self.
Any failure will be attached to the public at once.
The application has been criticized and the application was referred to as black or white skin.
Therefore , when the application provides a filter which could create an eye , teeth and face this week , some critics are called the racial irony of Asian " yellow ".
They even considered whether these repeated questions mean that the company has a larger problem in diversity.
The reports of The Verge and Motherboard reports on Wednesday were reported on Wednesday.
The company's explanation is that the filter is tribute to animation role rather than Asian.
But for the observers who have experienced racism , the filter reminds them of the reality of harmful stereotypes.
Others are also firmly opposed to these anime images.
These filters are " at least difficult and unwell " in an e-mail that was targeted at these photos.
" It is difficult to distinguish between the extreme nausea's irony and filters ".
Although the filter is not just yellow , the yellow was extremely degraded.
Snaphact is not the only company to touch these cultural lines.
From the company's board to Hollywood and the equipment we carry , American culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusion.
The large young group of Snaphact may be very sensitive because of more attention than the older generation.
When a filter in Snapchat produced an image of insulting the user , Juckati , 25-year-old , said in a Thursday interview: " Things are more difficult to escape people.
On Thursday , Ms. Zhu , a product manager and engineer , decided to delete her Snaphatt account and encouraged others to do so.
In an article written for Medimu and a telephone interview , she expressed herself that racial disputes reflected the lack of racial diversity in the recruitment process.
Ms. Zhu criticized the majority of the company's employees , and all the leadership for men and at the end of the article , together with a label: The department.
As an American Chinese American , Ms. Zhu said: " Either their employees have no color ethnic groups , they can take such decisions or some of their employees , but their positions cannot express them.
Other observers shared her complaints that she had not responded to Snaphact.
The company did not issue data on the diversity of employees and said it is a private company.
On Thursday , Spanchat refused to discuss its ethnic background , but a spokesman said that the company recently employed a recruiter specifically responsible for focusing on the lower proportion of internal percentages and in promoting internal inclusiveness.
Ms. Zhu said she will close her Snaphatt account: " I'd like to know whether they need more to oppose this behavior.
The Congressional Group said military officials distorted information on ISIS
In its report issued Thursday , a congressional group noted that the United States Central Command officials have changed intelligence reports and described the war in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State.
The midterm report comes from a special working group formed by the Republican President of the Military Committee of the House of Representatives , the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Commission of the House of Representatives . The Central Command intelligence analyst exists " wide grievance " , which expressed their superior assessment of their war for the US and ISIS.
The Central Command in Tampa , Florida is the military headquarters responsible for regulating the United States military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a public information on the report , " the information audited by the senior leadership of the Central Command is more optimistic to the United States counter-terrorism operations than the actual circumstances and always an analysis of other intelligence agencies.
The representative of California said: " The behavior of the Central Command is difficult to accept that our fighters are suffering from war and on the other side is an error analysis.
The leadership of the Central Command has extended to the highest level of the agency.
The report details the persistence of the central headquarters in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of the training of the Iraqi army in the United States.
Although there is no certainty , the Obama administration's high-level officials ordered these reports , but according to the report , these analysts feel that they have been pressured from the leadership of the Central Command , forcing them to make a more optimistic opinion on the threat of ISIS or ISLI.
" In the first half of 2015 , many central headquarters press releases , statements and congressional testimony are more optimistic than the actual situation . "
For example , an official of a central headquarter publicly expressed the possibility of taking a large military operation in April or May 2015.
Mosul , the second largest city of Iraq , is still under the control of States of Iran.
" After a few months of investigation , this result is very obvious , " Kansas's Republican representative said in a statement.
Most of the high-level intelligence officers of the United States Central Command manipulated the command intelligence products since the mid-2014 mid-2015.
The Republicans established a special working group where the ISIS information was manipulated from analysts.
With the continuation of the investigation , there will be more found after this report issued Thursday.
The Attorney-General of the Ministry of Defence also conducted a long-term investigation into the Central Command.
The Democratic Party of the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives published its results on Thursday and is consistent with the Republican special working group.
In a statement , the Commission's Democratic Leadership representative said that , between 2014 and 2015 , the Central Command developed an over-narrow process for intelligence assessments by the ISIS and Iraqi peacekeeping forces.
Mr. Shanda said the process " impedes information's cloth " , reducing the morale of analysts and " cannot accept different views ".
But Mr. Shanda and Democrats also said they did not find any evidence that the White House tried to exert pressure on the central headquarters' analysts , and their conclusions were consistent with " default or political narratives ".
The Beast Journal reported a preliminary result on Tuesday.
Last August , the New York Times reported a complaint from the Central Command Analyst that the Attorney-General of the Pentagon began to investigate.
In a statement , the Pentagon Spokesman , Major Patrick , said in a statement , the Ministry of National Defence did not publish any comments on the report of the National Congress.
But he said: " Experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex data and the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security themes.
The impact of the survey has exceeded the success of the United States-led bombardment operations in Iraq and Syria (an increasing number of defence officials).
Last year , however , these advocates enabled the public to question the extent to which President Obama could trust military action assessments in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis areas issued by the Central Command.
The criticism of the Islamic information concerned reminds the controversy over a decade ago , when the Central Command Intelligence Analyst Georgi Horger had prepared a study that pointed out that the Government of George W. Bush did not despite the numerous analysts , insisting on small-scale troops to travel to Iraq and almost did not consider the invasion of 2003.
Mr. Hook played a key role in the opposition activities of the Islamic country.
Last year , officials expressed the conclusion that Mr. Hook's team had concluded that air strikes against ISIS refiners had not significantly reduced the economic income of terrorist organizations , as the terrorist organization built the temporary refinery to continue to sell oil on the black market , which is different from the published statement.
According to the September report of the Times Weekly , the Central Command has not published this found.
When a number of lawyers reviewed the Senate testimony concerning the excessive optimism assessment of the war , the Central Command Commander of the Central Command was criticized last year.
General Austin was decommissioned in April and currently followed him at the Central Command.
The United States obtained four winning in the women's trilogies and will work with Britain
Kate Bay , threefore three dollars in Japan's competition over Japan , was taking the American women's hockey team to help the American team to overcome the Indian team.
The five goals of the two games were secret , but the 27-year-old Bam said she did not know that he had so excellent performance.
" I know nothing about it . "
I'm not that kind of people who will remember the ball.
What she knows is that the United States had achieved four winning at the Olympic Games and will compete for the first team on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States are narrowing on Saturday.
The two teams will decide who appeared in the first identity of the team.
The team's first team will avoid encountering powerful Netherlands so that the Netherlands will be far from the first team.
On Saturday's competition , the U.S. team created a miracle in an alarming performance . The United States would be known at the London Games four years ago.
Bam is also in that team.
Bam was growing up in Pennsylvania , the first time at 3 years of age picked up the hockey ball (her twin sister's in this movement) and joined the national team at 16.
She missed the 2008 Olympic Games because of failure to elect the final list.
In 2012 , she was not good for her teammates.
In the second year , the British part of the manager , and all began to change.
" It is a cultural , mental and substantial change . "
We did not reach the current level in London.
We've come to the total bottom.
On Thursday night , Bam in the last half of the backhand fire.
India has not tasted fruit in the competition , but the team showed an alarming tenacious fight and remained at the end of the third section , when Bam outbreaks.
She took a long distance to the left side of the stadium , and subsequently into the centre of the center , the United States team two leaders.
María González launched the last ball in section IV.
The United States was for the first time in the previous three victory in the first three victory.
This time she is exceptional.
Bam is also.
" We're good now " , but it's good to depend on the results of Saturday.
During the Depression of the Great Depression
In March 1933 , Franklin Roosevelt , who had just been elected as President , sat in the Office of the President.
As a good food , President Roosevelt likes the fifth good food , such as goose sauce and maryland water.
On that day , his menu is very simple: Tomato sauce , potatoes and the pudding as a snack.
" It's in order to suffer with the suffering people in food.
" This also reflects the American's diet , " her husband , Andrew Angelo , said.
This is the food historian for couples living in Brooklyn.
The previous book in the previous book is a Chinese food about the United States , and Ms. Zigming told the living story of the slum tenants in the book of her 97 orchards.
They will be published on Tuesday , which introduces the American food history in the Great Depression.
After demonstrating a common insight in food , they met a journalist in the sandwich store in Agenson . The simple lunch counter located in the ironing field has been business to now.
Ms. Zigming , 54 years old , pointed a cream cheese to olive sandwiches , while the 57-year-old section pointed out turkey , powder and vegetables.
The journalist sets a meat , which thinks these dishes suited to discuss the diet of the Great Depression.
" The bread was very popular . "
There were peanut bread , liver bread and soybean bread.
They are made of a raw material and a cheap head on the raw materials.
Imagine your dinner is peanut.
Mr. Section played a stranger.
" They are in your stomach , " he said.
For several years before the Great Depression , United States has been a break , especially in suburbs.
A group of women cooked for the male farm workers , and breakfast , lunch and dinner have the pie of the taste.
In the war , Americans have given food to hunger Europeans , which recorded how the country suddenly no longer becomes a richest.
Mr. Section explained why he and his wife would write this book: " The food had become the main topic which was to make Americans ".
The other unpleasant topic is the shabby new food: " Lost food " , such as bread and stew , became the main course , and the stew is " the best way of cuising cooking " , said Ms. Zigman , because the cookers can use the cream in the sauce.
Fresh fruits are replaced by cheaper fruit.
The meat of the American table has become a rare luxury for years.
The strange mixture considers only calories than taste and even basic cooking common sense that people consider nutrition.
In the process of studying this book , including various recipes , Ms. Zigman produced a great oil filled with oil.
" This is not common on the dinner table . "
" It's so strange , " said Ms. Zigming.
The oil is unable to match the roas.
This is the feature of many family meals.
Family economists affected the country's eating habits , such as Louis Stanley , the Chef of the Federal Economic Department for Family Authority , for 1923 to 1943.
They published recipes and articles in the newspapers and magazines , encouraging women to " calculate " and believe that a bad food such as cream pasta with carrots into food.
The big dinner is a great " historical flavor ".
It is particularly worth playing to respond to the government's response to hungry people , such as the presidential citizen Herbert Hoover's " I can't ".
Although he publicly commended the simple love farmhouse in his childhood , his diet was like a millionaire.
" He likes to eat European western food , such as fish accompanies.
He was wearing a night dress in a gold restaurant.

During the Beijing Olympic Games to the London Olympic Games , the problem of the United States is to replace the " first circle expert " Jeff.
The convoy is doing so in Sindes.
The decommissioning of Hoy is also leaving a blank , and Imardi Imadi and Marton Clarton wanted to fill this gap.
After seeing Skinner's potential , the British male team teacher insisted him to be elected to the national team , and Skinner eventually never.
Skinner's partner is Sindes and Kenny to win the gold medal four years ago with Hoy . Three people refreshed the Olympic record in the qualifier , but this achievement was beyond the first round of the New Zealand.
The three British vehicles eventually defeated opponents and won the gold.
Although Sindes is slightly backward , Kenny was leading the team , and Skinner maintains this leading advantage to the last.

I'm just doing my capabilities to make yourself more.
We created the Olympic record in the final and beat the world champion.

Nothing is better than this victory.
After winning gold medals in the London Games in London in 2012 with Kenya and Hoy, Sindes admitted to deliberately fall on the circuit under the start.
Subsequently , he withdrew the comments , and the rivals of the English team were not appealed.
The victory has no such problem.
" It's like the flag of Britain in London , " said Sindes.
We just teamed three months ago.
We have lost many world champions , so the Olympic champion is surprised.
This is just a gold medal in the Beijing Olympics and the London Olympics.
If this symbolizes the progress we have made over the past five months , we will continue to succeed in the business office five days.
According to the state of Kenya , he is not possible to won three gold medals at an Olympic Games.
If that's the same word that Hoy is 12 years old and similarly on 23 March (seemed to be the sacred day of the United Kingdom's sports , Steve Redregre , Mora Fara and Brown Browner also born on this day) Kenny will have six gold medals and one silver.
This achievement is along with Hoy.
Kenny took down to the start of three days today.
The 28-year-old Borton said: " I will focus on this game.
The team is always best.
You can win the game with mates.
Frankly , a man wins a little lonely.
" If he can win the other two gold medals , he should be given to the side.
This is the only medal game on the same day , but the team received other good news.
The four kilometres of the four kilometers have been promoted by Sir Brakin Villin , Steven and Everre.
Their achievements were 351.943.
The world record of gold medals in London in 2012 is 351.659.
The first round and finals (10 p.m. at 10 p.m.) were held today , and Wilkins will undoubtedly become one of the focus.
Yesterday he had a dispute with the competition officials before the qualifier , when the competition officials let him measure height.
Among the women's games that will be ended tomorrow , Lauratter Lauter , Joanne Rober Chandar , Eleanor Barco and Abduchard , from Miguel , promoted 412.360.

The director of the National Development Reform Coordination Division today notes that steel capacity is a global issue.
Our capacity utilization in recent years is higher than the global average and higher than countries and regions such as Europe.
Our country has taken strong effective measures to address excess capacity , and the effectiveness is progressive.
The head pointed out that the global problem of overcapacity in steel capacity was given high priority.
Departments and regions are actively implementing the deployment of the State Council and to work seriously and reduce the course steel capacity this year.
From our national circumstances , our country does not encourage steel exports , on the contrary that a series of practical measures control steel exports.
The head emphasized that international trade in steel products is essentially market behaviour and is the autonomous choice from the factors such as the needs of importing countries and consumer comprehensive consideration for products.
The implementation of trade protection measures does not contribute to the fundamental resolution of the development problems of the global steel industry , but only for international trade order.
When talking about obligations , the leader stressed that the debt resolution is an important issue that needs to be appropriately addressed in addressing excess capacity.
Since the size of the assets of steel enterprises involves a wide range of enterprises , some enterprises' debt relationships are complicated , and if there is no possibility , there may be a regional risk.
According to the head , in recent years , with economic downward pressure , the total needs of society gradually diminished , partially declining in capacity utilization and the difficulty of business production.
Some enterprises are not adapted to changes in the market environment and production operations are difficult to think that institutional mechanisms are constrained by some institutional mechanisms , more obstacles to market-oriented and become " zombie ".
The presence of such enterprises , distorting market signals , reducing the efficiency of element resources and increasing the cost of social management and hinders the establishment of a fair competitive market environment.
The main cause of losses is like the plight faced by the global steel industry - market demand and low capacity utilization.

In the afternoon , the Chinese tourist police appeared in Moscow's red field , which caused people's attention immediately , and Chinese tourists waved with a surprise , and local and foreign tourists stopped back.
On the same day , China's first professional tourism police force - the members of the Tourist Police Detachment of the Public Security Bureau of the Hainan Province arrived to the Moscow red field and exchange learning for local travel police.
The Moscow Tourism Police is divided into three group patrols in the red field , Nickle Street and Gum department stores , and China's tourist police worked together , and the whole process lasted for more than an hour.
She just joined the tourist police force last year this year.
He carefully observed the Russian counterpart and communicate with her from time to time.
When the Spanish visitors are consulted , the Moscow travel was patiently explained by fluent Spanish , which impressed Wang's Wang.
" Everyone in Moscow everyone has a foreign language or more than the two doors.
" Hainan as an international tourism island is gradually attaching progressive attention to attracting international tourists and we want to improve its own capacity to match the international tourism island.
The Chinese tourism police also communicated with their Russian counterparts to the Moscow City Tourism Police Brigade before they learned.
" I often deal with Chinese tourists and see them are very happy to come to Russia.
" They are usually helpful: How to go , where a monument , how to rent the hotel.
The urban environment and tourism atmosphere in Moscow have become increasingly better in Moscow in recent years , and the attractiveness of foreign tourists has increased in recent years.
In order to adapt to tourism development needs , the tourism police force is established in July 2014 to protect the various attractions and help and channel tourists.
At present , all Moscow tourist police officers are skilled in English and part of Spanish and German.
The police brigade divides them into nine teams on the basis of a foreign language level , twice a week , learning self-defence , laws and foreign languages.
" There are two tourism police officers starting to learn Chinese , and we already continue to improve their Chinese levels , " says Ressakov.
Mr. Rassakov told reporters that the Moscow travelers have accumulated a certain experience and hoped to be inspired by Sanya.

The future of Portland smelters full of uncertainty for the cancellation of power supply contracts
As a result of electricity companies electrically powered by the factory , all people in the factory will terminate a supply contract so that all supply contracts were invalidated , at Portland aluminum refinery in Victoria and hundreds of workers in the factory are now facing an uncertain future.
This initiative takes place after the Government of Victoria did not continue to issue subsidies to guarantee factory operations.
This 20-year fixed subsidy will terminate in November.
The 2,000 workers in Portland factories in Portland are likely to be unemployed.
Once the factory closes , you may have up to 2,000 people directly or indirectly.
And as a result of the factory's electricity consumption accounted for about 10 per cent of the Victorian electricity output , there may be a chain reaction.
In 2014 , the aluminium aluminum company closed the Han Hang Smelter , which led to the closure of the Angel Island power plant last year.
Portland smelter is currently losing and faces closure risks.
This is the first reason for the strengthening of the Australian dollar in the next few years , and recently because of the price of factory products.
AGL provides electrical energy for the large aluminium smelter through the large aluminum plant.
The largest shareholders of the factory are a joint venture of an aluminum company and alumina company , while China's Citic Group and Japan's Red Co.
" AGL is expecting the Portland factory to continue operation , that is , the smelter will continue to generate power demand . "
AGL indicated that these contracts should have been coming into effect from November 2016.
The end of the contract is 12 months , so they will terminate in 2017.
The power company said: " Therefore , AGL still predicts that these contracts will continue to produce income in the fiscal year 2017 . "
The impact of any income possible for AGL in the fiscal year 2018 is currently optimistic for wholesale prices.
AGL said the company has written up $ 187 million in the " termination expectation ".
The aluminum company said the decision to end these contracts " does not affect the ability of aluminum companies to operate the refinery or guarantee the smelter's electricity supply ".
The United States company said it signed a 20-year contract in 2010 , which would have entered into force in November this year , but the company did not explain why the contract was withdrawn.
Analysts close caution about whether Portland's smelter located in Victoria and the Tomago factories located in Newcastle will be closed because of a bad economic situation.
In response to the comments published by analysts earlier this week , AGL's operating history said Portland reached about 600 megawatts per year and the Tomago factory reached about 900 MW.
If two factories close , the demand for the electricity market will greatly reduce.
" As a power company , this is not a good news for us.
The Community Legal Centre will reject 160,000 people
More than 160,000 most vulnerable groups have been rejected by community legal centres each year . The funding of this service has been overstretched , and there is now further funding cuts.
In Queensland , three of each of the five people were rejected in seeking free legal advice and agent services , mostly older persons , migrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those without resources against unjust expulsion.
The lack of funds for community legal services has long exceeded limits and now faces further funding cuts.
Since June next year , the Federal Government's funding for these legal centres will reduce by 30%.
Thousands of people have been rejected in accordance with the latest national community association legal centre investigation report based on the latest national community association legal centre.
Mr. Farell said that if the federal government does not change the existing decision , this would only be worse.
" Queensland's community legal centre is in a long-term situation of inadequate funding , which means that thousands of people will not get the important services needed . "
People who need to be away from violence , people who are unable to reimburse large debts , families facing disintegrated families and pressed workers , are faced with legal dimensions , and the report shows that they cannot access the needed help.
The Federal Government will reduce the funding of 30 per cent since June 2017 , which means that thousands of vulnerable groups in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal issues without help.
We call upon the Minister of Justice and Member of Parliament Queensland to withdraw these decisions on these reductions immediately to allow people to obtain the needed help in the face of legal issues.
Last year , the state government pledged to increase legal aid funds to the national average.
The need for community legal centres and their counterparts must now be focused on the needs of community legal centres and their counterparts , which must also be invested in it.
Donald Trump's campaign was prosecuted for staff guns
New YORK: Trump's campaign team was prosecuted after a staff member in February.
The former software trainer of the state's campaign team described the event on Wednesday.

Britain must pass the Olympic spirit and expand on Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring dynamism and prosperity for our community , London and the country.
For me , this is the charm of Heathrow , as the London Games in London in 2012 were doing everything possible to ensure that our countries and regions can benefit from these events.
The Olympics have benefited from Strafford and Sector East.
And we will create opportunities for the local population and enterprises near Heathrow.
Only for our local communities , we will create 10,000 new apprentices , 40,000 new jobs and leave young people around the airport from unemployment.
As before the 2012 London Olympic Games , some people believe that the expansion of Heathrow is too big.
I was informed that Britain would not be prepared for the Olympics , and we will shame the world.
The suspicion of the 2012 Olympic Games is wrong , and their doubts about the Heathrow project will be proved to be error.
Despite the obstacles that need to be overcome , Heathrow is solving every one of the problems.
As the Olympics , Heathrow is an infrastructure project for most people rather than a few.
The expansion project will create up to 180,000 new jobs , bring about 211 billion economic growth , leaving a technical and employment wealth around the airport.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team . The team has completed 11 billion infrastructure investment projects on time and within the budget context , including T3 terminal of the global best airport terminal for five consecutive years and two runways located in the global busiest runway.
Now , they are prepared to build the third runway by pound 16 billion.
The United Kingdom has successfully hosted the London Olympics in 2012 , and I believe that the Heathrow airport expansion project will also have great success.
It is the good time we transferring the Olympic spirit and expanding Heathrow airport so that we can escort for our future and create a technological and employment wealth that makes Britain proud.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Heathrow Airport and former British Treasury Counsellor
A woman suicided and died over the Swiss highway
The victim lay on midnight on the highway.
The woman who tried to commit suicide was done on Thursday morning and the police is looking for witnesses.
The accident took place on the A1 highway near the morning of Vaud on Thursday.
The police of Vaud said a woman lay on the highway in the night' despair and had been run by a number of cars.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman , whose behaviour clearly carries a suicide intention . She was run by a car , including a truck.
The woman killed the spot.
The police revealed that multiple pilots had accepted the investigation , but some of the drivers are still unconfirming . The police are calling on them and witnesses of accidents to accept the investigation.
The Geneva Tribune has started criminal investigations to the Geneva Tribune , which is a conventional process of such events.
But it has not yet been known whether the driver is facing charges.
Is it possible to avoid collision ?
" This will be determined by the prosecutor ".
According to two similar cases of the past five years , the driver would not be responsible.
According to the report , these two cases were because they were caused by the highway in the night , and the final judgement is that the driver would not expect to cross the highway at midnight.
Last year , a police officer was accused of death as a result of negligence and that the allegations were introduced in August 2014 , where she impacted a man on the A1 highway near Paye.
The Tribunal was informed that the 22-year-old victim wore the road after drinking.
After the investigation , the judge stated that the female police were totally legitimate and that the man appeared " completely accidentally and unpredictable " , and the policewoman called the first aid telephone.
Anyone who could provide information on this accident near the mold on Thursday should be called 521 644 83 46 or 021 644 44.
NASA climate model: Venus is suitable for human living
According to NASA's new climate model , Venus has been suitable for human lives.
Scientists of the National Institute of Space Institute developed a model that can explore Venus' past situation , and the tools and algorithms used by the model are similar to the use of climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether Venus is similar to the Earth's environment whether the surface temperature , water and the atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide.
Previously , scientists believe that Venus rotation is slow as its atmosphere is thicker.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have a thin , similar to the earth's atmosphere and the speed of rotation at that time.
The model can also show the early terrain of Venus.
Venus's dry areas may be more than Earth , but there have been enough water and geographical changes to breed life and prevent fast evaporation.
Early , the brightness of sunlight in Venus was 30% than the Earth.
" In the model simulation of the Godad Institute of Space Institute , the slow rotation of Venus's slow rotation has longer than two months in the model simulation of the Godad Institute of Space.
This enables the surface to warm and produces a rainwater that can form the thick layer , which is like a umbrella to block most of the sun.
The result of simulation is that Venus's average climate temperature is actually lower than the earth.
The Venus evolution simulated by the model is similar to planetary scientists.
Although Venus may have existed life , Venus is exposed to high temperatures and ultraviolet ultraviolets in billions of years.
The ocean evaporates on the planet , and water steam is also burned by UV.
With the escape of hydrogen , there are only thicker carbon dioxide and deadly greenhouse gas effects , thereby forming the Venus we know today.
The researchers published the new Venus Climate Model in the Journal of Geophysical Research.

According to a joint statement , " Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm our agreement to restart the solution to the current dispute . "
We will begin earlier next week to revisit these issues in the next few weeks.
The trade union indicated that its recent action was to protest the highest possible reduction of 30 per cent of the pay cuts , which was the first time in 25 years.
The Wood Group reduced the remuneration of the North Sea contractor this year.
The company reduced the remuneration of maritime contractors in 2014 before the pay cut.
The company says once again pay cuts will help the company spend the market depression.
Shell has reduced thousands of employees and announced the plan to close the 10 countries with oil and gas equipment , because the company needs to streamline its business after merging with British energy company.
Energy companies are facing pressure from crude oil prices and the pressure of British decision in June.
A member of the Scottish Parliament , David Anderson , met with trade union leaders earlier this week to explore the largest labor dispute in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea is essential to the regional economy.
" In the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that serves most people rather than a minority.
In 2016 , expenditure for the North Sea new project is expected to not exceed $ 1.4 billion , while the average project expenditure over the past five years reached some $ 7 billion.
Speed of the rotation of the speed of the station in the station of the station
The latest mission of the space telescope is helping astronomers collect the most complete star rotation.
New data are helping astronomers know why the stars of the clusters have different rotation speeds and the rotation cycle and the planet composition.
" We hope to further understand the relationship between star quality , age , and even their history of the solar system by comparing our results and other clusters , " said the research scientist of the Infrared Analysis Center of Pasa Dinaga.
The cluster is 445 years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and are now just reaching years.
They reached the highest rotation rate in their life.
When reaching the highest rotation speed , these mature stars fired a lot of stars.
When these stars pass through the star's magnetic field , they will produce braking to stars.
With the increase in the age of the star , its rotation speed slows.
The speed of stars is measured by tracking recognized sunspots (like sunspot).
The latest rotation speed data set indicates that the rate of stars in quality is slower than a smaller star.
Raible rotates the speed of smaller dancers than dancers.
" In the clusters' ballet , we found that stars that are slowly rotating rates are often qualitatively quality and the fastest rate of rotation is often the lighter star.
Because the cluster is close , it can therefore be an ideal cosmic laboratory that compares the quality of stars and rotation.
" The cluster lays the foundation for the two-way rotation model of young and old stars.
We still have a lot of knowledge about how , when and why to slow down rotation and " fold our dances ".
Reburb and her colleagues elaborated in detail in three new papers . The three papers will soon be issued in the Astronomical Journal.
