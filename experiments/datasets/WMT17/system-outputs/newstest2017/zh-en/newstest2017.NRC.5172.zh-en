The 28-year-old chef was found dead in a San Francisco store
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a stairwell at a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to harm him, saying, "everything is finally getting better."
The head of the San Francisco coroner's office said the body found at the West Tian shopping centre on Wednesday morning confirmed Frank, a 28-year-old San Francisco resident.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was found to have killed him and was under investigation.
Brother Louis, the victim's brother, told ABC radio kg in San Francisco that Frank, who worked as a plumber in Boston, found an ideal job for a waterline chef at the Sons & Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & restaurant restaurant said they were "very shocked" about Frank's death.
"We are a small team with a close family and we will miss him dearly," the spokesman said.
In this sad moment, we express our deepest sympathy and condolences to Frank's family and friends.
Louis said Frank initially stayed at the reception, but recently "everything is finally getting better."
Louis told kg: "Frank found an apartment and was dating a girl."
Louis said he could not think of anyone who would want to kill his brother.
Frank has a good heart and a broad chest.
Louis said: "Frank often cooks dinner for his family."
He was never willing to argue with his family.
He is a man who follows everyone's opinion.
Louis said: "All things in the world are likely to be wrong, but Frank is a man who shines every day."
For clues, please call the San Francisco Police Department to report the call 415-575-4444.
Junior doctors' strike: Calls for new labor action
The junior doctors' representative called on the alliance to approve new Labour action against the new contract disputes.
The junior doctors committee of the British Medical Association will require all its members to support more labour action since early September.
The junior doctors committee said the ministers did not resolve the concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical science students voted in July to boycott the contract deal with the British Medical Association.
Among the members of the vote, 58% opposed the deal.
In a letter dated Thursday night on Twitter, the chairman of the junior doctors committee, Ellen McCourt, said that the government had "consistently remained silent" on the issue of resisting the contract.
She said: "In view of this, the Executive Committee of the junior doctors committee has voted to reject the proposed new contract and call for a formal consultation on all concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the Executive Committee of the junior doctors committee has today formally requested the Council of the British Medical Association to convene a special session to approve a long-term plan to upgrade the Labour operation from the beginning of September.
The dispute has led to a total of six strikes by junior doctors this year, including the first all-out strike in the history of the NHS.
Dr Johann Malawana, a junior doctor at the British Medical Association, resigned after a vote against the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the British Medical Association.
At a meeting of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students, he told members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should therefore be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed in England's medical staff.
Russia and Turkey: "Does not fit into the alliance"?
A gesture ended a crisis.
Russia and Turkey's leaders met on Tuesday, shaking hands and announcing a formal end to eight months of war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the president of Turkey in a splendid hall at the Palace of St. Petersburg, I had a strong feeling that the settlement was the most wanted of Ankara.
Yes, the two sides did shake hands.
However, even under Mr. Putin's usual standard of convergence, Putin is only a shallow smile, with little enthusiasm for enthusiasm.
According to reports, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has made five references to "good friend" Putin.
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised that his relationship with Russia would return to pre-crisis levels, even at a higher level.
The next day, a newspaper wrote that Mr Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
But I think his enthusiasm suggests something quite the opposite.
However, Mr. Putin's persistent indifference shows that he has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction was fierce.
Mr. Putin lashed out against the incident, accusing Ankara of plotting Moscow behind his back.
Attacks from so-called friends are even more difficult to accept.
The two sides are difficult or even impossible to re-establish real trust.
Since November, Russian public opinion has also shifted.
For months, the government-controlled media have carried out a shocking all-out offensive against Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
Among them, the most serious is the criticism of senior officials: Mr. Erdogan's family has benefited from illegal oil deals in Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has categorically denied the claim.
However, the news from St. Petersburg showed that it was time to look forward.
After all, the meeting is on the premise that Putin has received an apology from Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the truce is obvious.
First, Erdoğan narrowly escaped being ousted after a coup attempt last month, so he needs the support of all his friends.
The constant terrorist attack has obviously been a big blow to him.
At the same time, there are economic incentives.
Russian sanctions have dealt a huge blow to Turkey, in particular the ban on charter flights that can deliver millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The figure has fallen by nearly 90%.
As flights resume, Russia's travel agencies and charter companies will breathe a sigh of relief.
They will usher in the tide of the Mediterranean Sea at the end of the season.
State television even predicted this week that the price of fruits and vegetables will decline once Turkey's agricultural imports have been reopened.
A report from the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti said: "Tourists have gone and tomatoes come back."
For Moscow, the visit will also have additional political value.
Ankara is outraged by the weak response of the Western world to takeover intentions.
In addition, Ankara is unhappy with the slow progress of accession to the European Union and the longstanding frustration of Vladimir Putin, who is keen to exploit political chill and weaken Turkey's relationship with the West.
As a result of the endorsement of the elected authorities after the failure of the coup, the leaders of the Russian Federation will be given a bonus point in Ankara.
Note that this is a gift for Moscow, which has been deeply fearful of regime change.
As a result, the meeting held at the magnificent seaside palace gave Russia and Turkey two allies who have been rejected and abused by the Western world, and an analyst described it as a "gregarious alliance."
However, despite the public reconciliation, significant differences remain between the two sides.
Syria is one of the key factors and Moscow has played a role in Syria in recent days, while Russia and Turkey support the opposite faction.
It can be foreseen that after nearly three hours of preliminary talks, the two presidents said at a briefing that they had not yet talked about the topic.
Turkey's president has deliberately avoided questions about the differences between the two sides, while Putin emphasized.
The two sides have not reached a clear consensus on how to find common ground on Syria.
It is certainly a good thing for the leaders of the two countries to restart the dialogue in the wake of the months of public hostility and major disaster caused by Turkey's shooting down Russian warplanes in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
According to the chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank will be simplified as a back door.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwing told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was committed to its global ambitions.
But when it was on the verge of collapse eight years ago, it was forced to accept that the bailout had been abandoned since then.
During that time, brand strategist used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
The group has spent millions of pounds to sponsor international sporting events in the form of sponsoring rugby Six Nations and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But right now, the right thing is to make more national brands emerge.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not return to the original.
In England and Wales, all references to the headquarters and the stock exchange will be changed to the National Westminster Bank.
The Ulster Bank brand has been used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, more prominent, smaller private banking brands, such as the investment bank, Adam & Co, UNK and Holt's military bank.
Mr mcyoune has been interviewed for a tour of customers and staff in Inverness County.
"The Royal Bank of Scotland will eventually become our investor brand, as well as one of its employees, because we have become a bank with a lot of brands," he told BBC Scotland.
As the bank itself has become an international brand, RBS has become a global brand.
At the moment, I would like to say that we no longer focus on the world, and we have turned our attention to home.
Each brand represents the difference in their respective industries, and our employees serve customers through different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has indicated that it will not continue to sponsor the six-nation tournament; at the same time, efforts have been made to enhance the image of different brands in sports events.
The CEO said: "Now it is time to become a multi-brand bank because privately we have been exploring how to become a better service to customers."
If we aspire to become a big bank with a lot of brands three years ago, it will be derided.
At present, we focus on the needs of our customers and I am sure you have noticed these changes.
I think we can restart these brands, and the time is right now.
Diagram made a career 3, 000 win in Newcastle on the success of the prefect.
Newcastle's two victories helped him win a career of 3,000, after which he sprayed champagne to celebrate
On Friday, the professional jockey, Richard detto, won his 3rd, 3,000 victory at Newcastle.
He spent two victories on the horse road and won two victories on the horse, as well as a career 3,000 win.
The 40-year-old Italian is the sixth professional jockey to win this milestone in the field.
The top five were: Sir Gordon Richards (Gordon Richards), Doug Smith (Doug Smith), Percy pigments, weideli (Pat Edmond) and Wilson (Willie).
"This is very special," said David Tutu, a three-time champion jockey who won a victory earlier in Ghayyar.
I'm very excited because my family is on the scene
I am happy with my achievements in Newport, because I started here 30 years ago.
This is not a massive Jockey Club, nor is the Royal Edinburgh Jockey Club, which is just a regular Friday night with 20,000 spectators.
I'm very pleased and very humble.
David took the lead after the victory, causing the audience to cheer
In the field of hurdles, two cyclists have achieved this achievement, respectively, the champion jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20th champion, Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4,300 victories in his record-breaking career.
Cooper, who was the ninth German champion, won a total of 4,493 victories in his career.
Diagram is one of the greatest riders of the day, so it is no surprise that he has made this landmark achievement, and there are not many people who have made this achievement before.
He is stylish and robust, but it is his tactical reason to really let him stand out in the weighing room.
He is a great equestrian ambassador for many years, and his passion and charisma have attracted a lot of fans for the sport.
A couple of weeks ago, I said that if he was not just a weekend and a race jockey, he should have won 6,000 victories!
Indeed, it is too important to be the best equestrian winner in the UK for 30 years.
He has a lively personality, which is a good thing for the British horse racing, but on top of that, he is an incredible jockey.
Diagrams celebrate the milestone with its iconic jump in action
From the jump to the horse, for twenty years, diagram has been a typical representative of the British flat field.
His career as a roller coaster.
He won a number of championships, including the famous "seven wins" at the Royal Iowa Jockey Club in 1996, but he also suffered from the crash and was banned for taking banned drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned to the game after the end of six months, he was once very tired. However, he showed an amazing personality superiority and finally returned to the top of his head, giving those who are skeptical.
He may not have done it for a long time before he said that he wanted to compete at least 50 years ago.
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed Sergei Ivanov, chief of staff
Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, unexpectedly lifted the post of chief executive, Sergei Ivanov.
For many years, Mr. Ivanov has been part of a core group that has been trusted by Mr. Putin.
Mr Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed special representative for environment and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr. Putin had "announced the dismissal of Mr. Ivanov's director of the Office of the Russian president," but did not give a reason.
Anton Vaino, who started his deputy to Mr. Ivanov in 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, Estonia, in 1972, and graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIM), who worked in the Tokyo embassy.
Later, he managed the presidential draft and government employees, the Kremlin website (in Russian) said.
After his appointment, he said to Mr. Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of the government is to support the drafting of laws and control orders by the head of state.
Mr. Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr. Ivanov demanded his resignation and recommended Mr. Ouattara to succeed him.
Is such a convincing smile?
Moscow is puzzled by the move.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Putin's closest aides, like Putin, who has worked in the Soviet security service (KGB).
As chief of staff, he was one of the country's most influential figures.
On the national television broadcast of a meeting with President Putin, the two per capita said the chief of staff had asked to resign.
Despite smiling at the front of the camera, few people believe this time, especially before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this the result of the defeat of some kind of power struggle?
It is not yet known.
But the official claim that a man who was once seen as a presidential candidate suddenly chose to hold Russia's environmental policy has attracted a lot of suspicion.
On the Kremlin's website, citing Mr. Ivanov's dialogue with Mr. Putin, he said: "Yes, at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to give me this difficult position in a dialogue, even if it was a troublesome position for four years."
"As a result, I have served as director of the presidential office for four years and eight months."
Mr Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council, as well as Mr. Putin, a former member of the National Security Service.
At the end of the 1990s, when Mr. Putin became the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly the National Security Agency), Mr. Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
After Mr. Putin came to power, he also appointed Mr. Ivanov as one of his most trusted people.
It was once thought that Mr. Ivanov could serve as president of the Russian president after Mr. Putin's second term, because he was unconstitutional.
But the position was ultimately attributed to Putin's another close aide, Dmitry Medvedev.
Prior to his return to the presidency after three and a half years, Mr. Putin served as prime minister of Russia.
The mysterious fish shocked the Banff garden
A resident of Banff found fish surprised at his own garden and then sent for help.
Kevin believes that the 75 fish could have been blown by a tornado in the sea.
Mr. UNK, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a video of this strange scene on perislander, hoping someone could explain to him why these two inches of fish would appear.
The Stamford Bridge is now available to the Faf
The $1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017
The engineers have linked the North Bridge of the Kunduz bridge to the high bridge, which is to say that the bridge is now connected to the Faf.
The "bridge fan," which is located near the three bridges in each big bridge, is now close to completion, and the project is the first bridge of the Dragon.
The bridge, which started in Fife, is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 metric tons.
It employs 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 cables.
The $1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Keith Brown, the economy minister, visited the scene today and became one of the first people to climb the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic moment in the construction of the Quays bridge."
We have all witnessed the engineering work on such a grand project, which uses more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel for the construction of the bridge.
Although the size and weight of the bridge is huge, the completion of the bridge between the bridge and the bridge requires fine work, which requires a very precise assembly.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge has now been installed, and the final section of the concrete bridge is being poured in Rosyth today, which means that all the bridges are ready.
"Whether it is a bridge project, it is a major milestone for the first time," said Michael Martin, director of the construction company project.
As far as this remarkable project is concerned, the Dragon has demonstrated the frontier of civil engineering.
After installing the last section of the circuit panel and connecting it to the expanded North Bridge, the remaining gap in the north or near the land will need to be finished.
The completion of the operation will require the removal of 700 millimetres south of the northern elevated bridge.
This is a massive operation, but also a very sophisticated operation.
It said it was huge because the high bridge, 222 metres long, weighed about 6,000 metric tons and needed to pull out about 3% of the slope.
It is sophisticated because the engineering team needs to make sure the deviation is very small, with only a few millimeters per side.
It is gratifying that everything is going well.
Simon Biden picked the women's gymnastics all-around champion
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is not affected by all this.
The vault is full of energy.
There is a lot of fun on the balance beam.
Gymnastics is stunning.
The overall performance was excellent.
Now, it has finally become an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast picked the all-around champion on Thursday and fully displayed her talent in gymnastics at the Olympic Stadium.
She won a total of 62.198 at the top of the silver medal winner, "the ultimate five-person group" (UNK Raisman) and a bronze medal winner, Aliya Mustafina.
Simon Byron, from the United States, performed a balance beam at the women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
He helped the United States to achieve four consecutive titles at the women's gymnastics individual at the Olympic Games, and her individual won five medals at the current Olympic Games, further confirming that she was the generation and probably the best sports player ever.
When he saw his total score, he could not help but shed tears. She finally finished the long journey.
He therefore ranks among the "dozens of years of athletes" like Michael Phelps, who raised sports in their respective fields to new heights:
He has won 15 world championships, including 10 gold medals in the last three years, including ten gold medals, according to Mary Lou Retton, an Olympic champion in 1984, who is the best gymnast I've ever seen.
There is also the last game in Brazil, but the game is not so much the competition with other gymnasts as the rivalry between herself and the great expectation.
If Biden did not return to her home in Springfield, Texas, everyone would be very disappointed.
Simon (left), from the United States, embraced with Leslie, who won gold and silver in the women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August (Thursday).
Biden won his first gold medal on Tuesday, offering a surprise gift to the retiring national coach, Martha Karolyi.
Although he insisted he did not plan for the future in the years leading up to the championship, it is not entirely true.
A part of Bayer's free gymnastics, which includes her iconic somersault, matched the Latin music, which she used to listen to only one street from the Rio Olympic Stadium.
This is no coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by his grandparents during the baby period, and who was found by coach Amy Boorman, who was on a field trip to the stadium, has now grown into a backbone.
Since the summer of 2013, he has not lost his hands in the game, and she will win only if she wants to win.
It was a bit of an illusion that it was just a bit ahead of Mustafa's two spin.
The defending world champion of the two projects, the balance beam and the freestyle gymnastics, lay in wait.
Her balance beam scored 15.433, with free gymnastics scoring 15.933.
When he waited for the final score, Lesman gave him a gentle hug, and when he learned that he had achieved his dream, he left a tear.
Leslie's performance was a bit like the revenge of four years ago, when she was third, but lost to Mustafa in the winner.
But this time, the 22-year-old, who was portrayed by the Americans as "grandma," was far ahead of the team.
She blew kisses to the crowd at the end of the free gymnastics and declared a return, but it appeared to be in doubt.
He was 19 years old, and since earlier this week, the news has spread like a virus. In the case of Charles, his life has been given a whole new meaning.
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who was in the middle of the body, survived the shooting in Philadelphia
Police said a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, a six-year-old child in the city's second shot this week.
The child's grandparents confirmed to CBS News that the child who was shot was Mahaj Brown.
They said there were multiple gunshot wounds to Brown's groin, legs, arms and abdomen, but the child was awake on the way to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot of crime, and the little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melvin told the television station.
I can't believe it.
The boy was in a critical condition in hospital and has undergone multiple surgeries.
His family told the television station that the child is expected to recover.
He was supposed to start a year at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who had been shot in the downtown area.
Of the three other people who were shot, two were 29 years old and one was 32 years old.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims was in critical condition; the other two victims were in stable condition.
Television said the child, who was in critical condition with the 29-year-old, was found in the front seat of the car.
Two other victims were not in the vehicle, and the police were investigating whether there were gunmen in the injured.
Investigators told CBS News that it looked like multiple gunmen exchanged fire.
A number of bullet casings were found at the scene, which could infer that they were using different offensive weapons.
Judging by this, it is undoubtedly a continuing battle.
There are shells on the pavement on both sides of the street.
"So, it can be seen at the time that there were a number of armed men in a state of war," the Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
A number of homes and vehicles were damaged in the area.
The arrests have not yet been carried out, and police are said to have watched the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, there was a six-year-old child (girl), who was shot in the arm while playing at the door of the West AK Lane community.
She is currently recovering and the police are still searching for suspects.
Why we need Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie
This is how I evaluated this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First, since 1984, I have been to every summer Olympics, but the United States has never been so dominant.
Second, the team has three excellent gymnasts Simone Biles, Gabriele Douglas (UNK Douglas) and Laurie Hernandez, who have been inspired by a variety of coloured girls.
The composition of the team is a source of pride for everyone, because it contains the Jewish aleraisman and the Catholic Madison Koshi (Madison Kocian).
The team finally looks like America.
It also strengthens the pinnacle of black and Latino women in the sport.
For the past four years, the leading female gymnasts have been African Americans.
Last year, Simon and Gabriele ranked first and second.
It's too bad.
At the last Olympics, Gabriela Douglas "unexpectedly" became the Olympic champion, which cheered the United States.
Today, the world is able to witness the performance of the three world champions Simon Myers, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who performed the routine gymnastics skills.
On Thursday, Simon helped the U.S. team achieve four consecutive titles on the women's individual all-around project.
Her teammate, Ali Leisman, won a silver medal.
We climbed to the top of the sport, but this was not the case in the all-American gymnastics class.
Simon, Gabriel and Laurie entered the Olympic team's way as well as Ali and Madison.
They are the "ultimate five-person group" (final five), because the next Olympic sports team will be made up of four gymnasts, and this is the last year of Marta Karolyi.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a costly exercise, and gymnasts are trained mainly in the private gymnastics club, where their parents need to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (including the associated costs of coaches and gymnasts and family members), and the list of costs is increasing.
Most of the gymnastics clubs are located in the affluent suburbs that can provide support for the industry.
All the gymnasts' training is completed in these clubs, which is a long and expensive expense for the gymnasts' families.
Biden's coach, Amy Boorman and Hernandez's coach, Maggie Haney, have been teaching them since the two gymnasts began practicing gymnastics.
We have to bring more affordable, more accessible gymnastic training to millions of young girls who have been affected by Simon, Gabriel and Laurie.
Twenty years ago, I set up my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we offer free, cheap gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youth, mainly black and Hispanic, in the black residential area, and develop national and even world champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this learning opportunity and will benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Gymnastics helps to cultivate the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, but also helps to cultivate the spirit, self-discipline and determination of hard work.
These can provide lifelong benefits for a person's health, education and work.
Encouraged by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Taking part in sports is significant, especially for girls.
It was an exciting moment.
Thanks to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabriel and Madison for the "girl power" that featured in winning the Olympic team's gold medal, and thanks to the young girls who inspired so many different backgrounds to open the path to health, strength and success.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, the junior doctors plan to launch a further strike
The ministers initially hoped to end the dispute by accepting the revised contract by officials of the British Medical Association, but of the 37,000 junior doctors who participated in the vote, 58% opposed the contract.
In July, Mr. Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract, saying that the NHS is currently in a "vacuum" and that a slight delay would hurt the interests of employees and patients.
The new contract first referred to the revision of junior doctors overnight and weekend working practices to improve the care of irregular working hours.
In a statement last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the junior doctors committee, said in a statement: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, with particular concern that it will exacerbate the current Labour crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors signed a new contract, and we need to make progress, and time is running out.
Efforts have been made to resolve the dispute through negotiation, but people are reluctant to participate, and sometimes the government responds with silence.
Nonetheless, just last month we got the promise of Jeremy Hunt, who said his door was always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to take action now to cancel the enforcement and solve the problem of junior doctors."
If he does not, the junior doctor has made it clear that they are ready to take further industrial action.
The last strike took place at the end of April, leading to nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and medical doctors were covered by doctors on the picket line.
Ministers initially hoped to end the dispute over the change by accepting the revised contract.
It hopes to secure a better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract.
The NHS chief executive Daniel Mortimer called on junior doctors not to launch any strikes again.
"There is little effect on labor action, but on the contrary, it will put pressure on the forces and services that have been poured into full force, leading to fear, anxiety and confusion among patients, caregivers and their families," Mr. Moore said.
Over the past two months, we have continued to negotiate with the junior doctors committee, along with the Ministry of Health and other departments to actively respond to their concerns about the role of the Guardian and the disclosure of the report.
Employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics such as deployment, training flexibility, other training, training costs for those who have been reinstated in their careers, training costs, common knowledge of the curriculum, and the gender wage gap in the curriculum, the health education organization of England and the Ministry of Health attached great importance to the agreements reached in November, February and May.
2 pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Officials have proposed to extend a drug of 2 pounds a day to more patients and to extend the duration of medication, after thousands of heart patients will benefit from the drug.
Anti-coagulation drugs (ticagrelor) can reduce the risk of heart attack in patients suffering from heart disease.
The drug lasts for 12 months after a heart attack, which can reduce the risk of stroke or heart attack.
The National Institute of Health and Clinical optimization of the NHS (NHS) advises patients to continue their medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now NHS regulators have advised patients to continue their medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease each year, and a quarter of them will continue to suffer from a heart attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fatty substances in the wall of the artery.
If the plaque is broken, it can lead to thrombosis, which can then block blood flow to the heart, leading to a heart attack.
If the clot moves, it will enter the bloodstream, blocking the flow of blood into the brain, leading to stroke.
Patients who have experienced a heart attack have a higher risk of heart attack.
It is possible to reduce the risk of morbidity by reducing the formation of blood clots, which is made by the British company Asley.
The draft guide, released today, advises patients to take 90 mg of cargray for 12 months, and for the next three years to take 60mg and two aspirin each day.
"Despite effective secondary prevention treatment, up to a quarter of the patients who have had a heart attack will have a relapse or stroke, often with serious consequences," said Professor Michael Longson, director of the Health Technology Assessment Center.
The fear of recurrence will have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Evidence suggests that taking cargray with aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients who have suffered a heart attack.
We are heartened by the fact that the interim recommendation will offer more treatment options for the thousands of people who have benefited.
The draft guidance does not recommend the continuation of treatment after this period due to the limited information on the efficacy and safety of kalgray after three years, particularly the risk of bleeding.
Computer culture puts the "electoral fraud" prevalent in Muslim areas
Lutfur Rahman, a former mayor, prompted a government report to be published amid corruption last year.
The "political correctness" culture has caused widespread electoral fraud in the Muslim community to be ignored, and the devastating government report reveals today.
Sir Eric Pierce, the former cabinet minister, accused the police, the election regulator and the city hall of ignoring evidence of abuse of the election because of "excessive sensitivity to racial and religious issues."
The former Minister of Community Affairs, the current anti-corruption chief, said the use of religious positions to intimidate voters was bad, and the police should be allowed to set up a cordon outside the polling station to protect the frightened voters.
He suggested that voters should carry identity documents in order to confirm their identity.
Currently, voters need to give their names and addresses.
The report even suggests putting ink on the fingers of the electorate to prevent a second vote.
Sir Eric said that there should be greater protection for whistleblowers.
He called for increased media access to the documents of the Conference and the decisions taken by the unofficial committee or the working group.
"This is not just to prevent electoral fraud, but to protect the local government from a widespread culture of corruption and the poison of financial fraud, which is closely linked to it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street after an election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special electoral tribunal ruled that the mayor, Rahman, had a series of corrupt and illegal practices and should be dismissed.
The court found that Rahman was "very ridiculous to abuse" the religious feelings of the Muslim community and kept silent about his allegations of racial discrimination and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "declared his vote to be a religious duty of loyal Muslims during the campaign."
Up to 300 votes are in doubt, and it is likely that voters will vote for others.
Sir Eric said there is evidence of electoral fraud across the country.
In particular, he alerted the post election fraud, and the senior members of the Muslim community were said to have put pressure on the electorate to force the voters to vote for their designated candidate.
Sir Eric (pictured) gave a number of suggestions for the liquidation of the voting mechanism, including the identification of identity documents to confirm their identity
"The evidence shows that senior members, particularly those in the background community of Pakistan and Bangladesh, have put pressure on the vulnerable groups in a number of ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, and let them vote according to their wishes," he said in the report.
"Because of the over-sensitivity of ethnic divisions and religious' political correctness', they fear that state institutions will turn a blind eye to such behavior."
Sir Eric has proposed 50 proposals to clean up the electoral mechanism, including a ban on political activists to deal with postal ballot papers to stop the "vote harvest."
The report also calls for the investigation of registration information to prevent voter rosters being used for immigration and welfare fraud, and Theresa May is also considering the report.
The proposals include requiring voters to show their identification documents before the vote.
After the vote, erased ink on the finger of the electorate to prevent a second vote.
Systematic verification of the nationality of the electorate to ensure the voting eligibility.
The period of validity of the automatic postal ballot request is limited to three years.
Political activists and militants are prohibited from dealing with the completed mailing lists and postal ballot envelopes.
Police authorized the police to set up a cordon around the polling station.
The amendment of the provisions of the law makes it easier to accuse the relevant persons of intimidation in accordance with the people's representative Act 1983.
It is illegal to take photographs at the polling station.
It is stipulated that English (except Wales) can only be used at polling stations.
Strengthening training to ensure that staff members strictly enforce the provisions of "voters go to the polling office separately."
Sir Eric deplored the Metropolitan Police (Metropolitan Police), saying that they were "surprised" by the fact that they had not filed any criminal charges after the incident.
"Mr. Rahman and his election officers have a lot of corruption and illegal behaviour, so they have been disqualified from the electoral tribunal," he said.
According to the standard of criminal proof, he has no doubt in many ways to be guilty.
He also criticized the fictitious "check box" of the electoral registration department of the City Hall.
Sir Eric said: "Last year the court heard a wake-up call to everyone."
My country has a glorious tradition of "the mother of Parliament," but it is also a source of concern and a threat to this good reputation, despite the fact that some institutions secretly secretly engage in electoral fraud and the aftermath.

The narrator of the Olympic Games made an apology for the Chinese swimmer's "slow" comments like pigs
Byron McDonald, on Wednesday, angered the 14-year-old boy, who received a fourth in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay, and infuriated the audience who watched the live broadcast of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
A commentator from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer will "swim faster than the stench" at the start of the race, and finally "is as slow as a pig" after being forced to apologize.
The commentator Byron MacDonald published some of his views at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay, when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
"The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake," said Byron, who listened to the commentator's team, who was wearing the "coloured glasses"
Because he was so excited, he swam faster than the stench at the beginning, but later it was as slow as a pig.
It was thanks to her.
It was the second best for Chinese swimmers, aged 14, to swim with time 1, 57 seconds, 79 behind Canada's Taylor Ruck (Taylor ruck) 1.61 seconds, and then the team narrowed the gap with China.
The entire Canadian audience was shocked by the commentator's tone and language, and they quickly reacted to the Internet
"The commentator said that China's 14-year-old swimmer was' slow 'like a pig'??
This idiot didn't realise it was being broadcast.
The Chinese novelist, who participated in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final, said: "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake."
Twitter's criticism of Byron MacDonald was quick to pounce on Twitter, and a lot of people asked him to quit.
When Twitter users heard that Byron MacDonald was slow to react, they did not stop there.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Parker, wrote: "Wow # Byron MacDonald.
You represent you and Canada, and your words and deeds make us all sound like a bunch of racists.
Soon after, the radio presenter Scott was apologizing for Byron's comments, saying: "We apologise for the performance of the live swimmer."
"We are very sorry for this inappropriate wording."
I apologize to those Twitter users who responded to the comment more than 90 times
Another commentator, Scott Foley, also apologized for Byron
Later, they copied their apology and pasted them to more than 90 Twitter users who protested Byron's explanation
The channel also quickly made an apology and issued a statement.
We are extremely sorry to say such a thing and broadcast it out.
Last night, we took prompt action to apologize to the viewers who watched us live and on social media.
What is needed is that Byron's commentary is aimed at the performance of swimmers, but not for her.
That is to say, the wording is not appropriate, and Byron is deeply sorry for this.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologised in the broadcast, saying his words did not mean a half-point personal attack, and attempted to take it off for his comments.
"I want to take some time to apologize for the comments I made yesterday evening after the women's relay race," he said in a televised broadcast.
"I'm just commenting on the performance of swimmers, not against them."
"Of course, I don't mean disrespect, I'm sorry."

A woman took off her underwear in the middle of a shop, where customers did not know where to look.
To make matters worse, she also looked at how she looked and then took off her underwear and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelves and eventually tested four pairs of underwear at the store in the Bouverie Place shopping center, which is located in stone.
The woman has been experimenting with underwear in the store at the Bouverie Place shopping center in UNK, and then put it back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson (mother of two children), who was also at the store, said that after testing her underwear, the mysterious woman "got dressed again, then walked out of the store and didn't buy anything."
"You can't believe what you see," she said.
She stood in the middle of the store, took off a pair of underwear from the shelf, took off her tights and underwear, and then put it on.
"She did not try to find a secluded place to try it - she was just standing there, and it was so brazen."
"When she took her underwear off again, everyone was stunned. Obviously, she was not satisfied, because she put her underwear back on the shelf."
After that, she tried again, and finally found that she did not like it, and then dressed again and went out of the shop.
"She did not seem to care that someone was looking at her or she did not think who would eventually buy the underwear she had tried."
Ms Davidson, who lives in the town of Kent, said: "I feel sick at the thought that someone will buy the underwear that someone else goes through without being washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: "After she left, the clerk obviously had to deal with these underwear, but fortunately it was."
"I hate to buy a new pair of underwear, but found that another woman has tried it and has not been washed."
A spokesman for the company said: "The company has been aware of what happened on August 9 (Tuesday) in our store."
All the items have been laid down.
How to protect yourself in a gun attack using gamma
The world is dangerous, but the video on YouTube may give you a sense of security.
We asked the master of Krav Maga Federation in New York to ask for advice on how to approach the gunman at close range.
Whether he is in front or behind you, the video will teach you how to turn defeat.
'If the gunman is coming from behind you, the first thing you have to do is turn around, so that you can see the attacker and "clear the fire.
Then, hold the gun with your forearm and shoulder, then hit the attacker's face with your elbow.
Then, with a knee top of his groin, when the attacker bent down for pain, turned the gun in his hand, hit him in the face with a gun pipe and a backup gun, and kept his weapon against him.
If the gunman is close to the front and uses a similar technique to get your body out of the fire, grab the gun and turn the gun around, so that the shooter cannot fire.
At the same time, the weight was pressed on the gun and struck the attacker's chest and turned the gun from his grip and then pointed the gun at him.
Sounds complicated?
Take a look at the video and take a look at what syrachi did.
But remember, if you're not a gamma master, to get rid of the robbery, the safest way is to hand over cash.
A rogue family destroyed the low-cost rental housing in soltash, Cornwall, before being expelled.
A rogue family, who was ousted as a result of the intimidation of his neighbours, destroyed the low-cost rental house before leaving, resulting in a loss of 50,000 pounds.
After a long string of complaints, Tanya Skeldon was driven out of the low-cost rental housing in soltash, Cornwall, with her husband.
After being forcibly removed from the residence, the housing association officials were surprised to find that there was serious damage.
There was a hole all over the wall, the floor was torn, and the rubbish was strewn all over the ground, and the walls were painted in a mess.
The family has been moving after being expelled, and is said to have been living in private homes
'She was worried that the House could not be saved,' said Donna McBride, housing manager at the Cornwall Housing Association.
"This is a nightmare for people who live here, and I don't think people can live like this," she said.
There are a lot of things to weigh up now, because the House is likely to be a bad element in Cornwall.
This family is notorious and their names are equally notorious.
The couple had three sons and they would stay here from time to time, the police said, including the use of baseball sticks in the street fighting, intimidation of nearby residents, drugs, drug trafficking, shouting, bickering and cursing.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant named Skeldon received a resolution on anti-social behaviour.
In this House, which is likely to be demolished, many rooms are kept for a long time.
The floor was raised in this room where drugs were once traded
Neighbours said they often saw them fighting in the streets and often called the police
After giving them a voluntary move for an extended period of 11 weeks, the Cornwall Housing Association forced her to leave the house with her husband this week.
The neighbours, who were finally relieved, cheered for it, saying that the previous life was a hell.
One neighbour said: "They don't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it's been so bad.
We have seen the police gate countless times.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up early, because it was so quiet that we're not used to it!
They were finally gone, it was very nice.
"The family has failed to cooperate with the local government," said Adam Jacobs, a community executive manager at the Cornwall Housing Association.
The family lived in the house for 20 years and the police regularly visit
Rubbish and old toys were dumped on the side of the cheap rent
He added: "It is regrettable that the tenant did not take any responsibility for her behaviour with her family, and that the expulsion was the final consideration of the Cornwall Housing Association."
This is a very difficult case to deal with, because their behavior is extremely extreme, and their actions must also give their neighbours a sense of fear.
I am grateful to my team for the work I have done, and also to the community members of Devon and Cornwall Police who are brave enough to provide information to us.
I hope that this will bring some comfort to the neighbours and convey the message that we will not tolerate anti-social behaviour.
Mr Obama said their three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress was thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms, after they were driven away.
The housing association workers will soon clean up piles of rubbish around the house
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana and found balance, drug use and 1,700 pounds of cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of class B drugs and drug trafficking.
She claimed that the money was used to buy a tombstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is understood that after homelessness, Tanya and her husband are now living in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of the house were covered with graffiti.
The police said they would evict tenants who violate the rules.
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
"This warning is aimed at those who believe that their actions will not be blamed, and those who have been devastated by this behaviour," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police never tolerate crime and antisocial behaviour, and they will continue to work together to protect our communities.
Reid: Hillary Clinton will nominate Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president
The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid, said he was convinced that if the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, was elected president, she would nominate Judge Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have been blocking the confirmation of Garland since Barack Obama's presidential nomination in March.
Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said the next president would choose the person to replace the deceased Supreme Court judge, Sri Lanka.
Reid said in a conference call on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would opt for "some credibility" of Garland.
A spokeswoman for Reid later said that Reid did not have a direct conversation with Hillary Clinton and said he was just guessing.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team did not want to "mess up" for the new candidate.
Garland is the chief justice of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Reid said it was the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, and the "winner" of the Republican presidential nominee.
He said that Trump is unfit to be president.
"Treats": Naked calendar "men and women alike"
"Treats magazine will go hand in hand with photographer David UNK to shoot a set of inspiration from the 2017 calendar in the 1970s.
This time, they plan to look for a new generation of top models for their 2017 Nu mcalendar, rather than the famous nude.
Steve Shaw, president of treats, said earlier this year that they were different from the old Playboy in a nude magazine because "the latter is for men."
And we are for women.
Obviously, he thinks that this group calendar is also true.
"We need to show the timeless and classic nudity that makes women and men feel at home, and this is the inspiration," Shaw said at a presentation at a calendar.
Women will be happy to take part in this film because it is a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit photos on the line, but also go to the public recruitment site in Los Angeles and New York.

The French court dismissed the petition for the removal of shops in the Jungle refugee camp
A French court dismissed the government's petition to dismantle dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the "Jungle" camp, where thousands of refugees are currently living in the camp.
At the Court's hearing this week, the government of Calais argued that the French government should have the power to dismantle a total of 72 makeshift shops in the camp, which sold goods and services from cigarettes to energy drinks in the camps, and sold tea at 50 cents (40 pence) in makeshift restaurants and sold the basic meal at a few euros.
The governor's office believes the places should be demolished because they are a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, as well as fire and health hazards.
Humanitarian groups have said to the court that these shops and restaurants are extremely important, as the free food provided by the National Support Association and other groups is simply unable to meet the needs of the growing refugee population in the camp.
They said the makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for needy people.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel operators of the 72 temporary stores, but said that the governor's concerns were "entirely understandable."
The role of these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants is far more than simply providing food to refugees who are "living in extremely dangerous conditions," the judge said.
He said that these places are a peaceful convergence between refugees and volunteers.
One of the threats is the "UNK book" cafe in the refugee camp, which provides 200 food, English and French classes a day, and offers asylum advice for hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the cafe.
A letter to the Guardian wrote that the closure of the cafe "will be a catastrophe for these children, many of whom are only eight years old."
The two charities said Friday that the number of refugees in the Jungle camp has exceeded 9,000, which is the highest level since the surge in the number of refugees in the summer.
"This 5,000 yuan funding gives me a sense of urgency."

More than half a million yuan has been consolidated this year, with a financial self-financing of more than 2.5 million yuan, from the financial sector to the poor students' real bank card in accordance with the prescribed time limit.
She said gratefully, "I thought my father died, my brother and I were not a big school, I did not expect the county to solve the difficulties in time."
As of August 8, it had implemented 13140 poor students to implement various relief funds in the first half of this year, more than 21 million yuan.
All poor students in the county have achieved the support and the supplement.

Today, the reporter learned from the State Administration of Taxation that at the end of June this year, the tax authorities at all levels had published 2470 cases of the "black list" of tax laws.
It is understood that, in July 2014, the State Administration of Taxation took a step ahead of the central government's functional department, and in conjunction with the tax credit management scheme, the information disclosure scheme for major tax violations was published.
Not only the facts of the case, the legal basis, the handling of the penalty will be made public, and the basic information of the illegal parties, as well as those responsible for the relevant intermediary institutions, will also be included in the "black list."

"Environmental problems are manifested in the atmosphere, water and soil pollution, but the roots are still in the mode of production."
For example, the land development in Jiangsu Province reached 21% in 2015, the highest number of provinces and autonomous regions.
As a result, the problem of high pollution, large energy and multi-location has not been fundamentally addressed from the transformation of production lifestyle.
On the one hand, from the creation of the ecological environment at all levels in Jiangsu province, it is the first place in the country with absolute superiority, but on the other hand, the resource environment carries pressure.
In order to promote the protection and governance of the ecological environment, we need to promote the transformation of production and life in a fundamental way so as to promote the transformation of the people with ecological civilization.

Qingdao is the 12th of the country and the first in Shandong province to have paid use and trading pilot cities.
On 11th August, a number of enterprises have come to the decontamination rights trading center of Qingdao municipality to submit the expropriation rights requisition, and the requisition fee will be paid after the acceptance.
The deal, which is about to be completed, is also a sign of the formal opening of the pilot work on the decontamination rights trading in Qingdao, which will also be the first single and national municipal decontamination rights transaction.
On the morning of the 11thth morning, Zhao Xianping, general manager of Qingdao twin peaches and fine chemical (Group) Co., came to the Center for the decontamination rights of the Qingdao municipal decontamination rights trading center.
The enterprise located in the old city of Qingdao is completely shut down at the end of last year, the environmental relocation to the level of the new plant.
Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, the construction project environmental impact report and other materials, the Qingdao municipal decontamination rights reserve and trading service center began a preliminary review of the application materials.
According to the criteria established by the municipal price, finance and other sectors of Qingdao, the utilization fee of the initial decontamination authority is currently estimated at $61.2 million, and the staff will complete the approval within seven working days.
The deal, which is about to be completed, is also a sign of the formal opening of the pilot work on the decontamination rights trading in Qingdao, which will also be the first single and national municipal decontamination rights transaction.
Zhao Xiping said that the current enterprise environmental protection has invested up to 4 billion, the surface is huge, but it has great influence on business management philosophy and social benefit, and also opened up space for enterprise innovation management.
On the same day, Qingdao quartet xinzhengzhi passenger car accessories Co., Ltd., also for the annual production of 4200 high-speed rail and motor vehicle accessories project requisitioning the right to discharge.
The project is a mechanical processing enterprise, and the initial discharge right of the application is chemical oxygen demand (CD) 0.514 tonnes / year, ammonia nitrogen (NX) 0.052 tonnes / year.
Air pollutant discharge right has paid use and trading for the city's electric power and heat production to supply key industrial enterprises.
The existing sewerage units, which have been endorsed by January 1 2016, will not be levied on paid royalties.
"The right to decontamination is not equal to the right to an illegal discharge, and will not be able to discharge pollutants arbitrarily."
Han Hongyan, deputy director of the environmental protection bureau of Qingdao, said that it would not be possible to allow illegal enterprises to avoid punishment by purchasing the right to decontamination, if they were to be punished in accordance with the relevant regulations.
That is to say, through legal means to crack down on environmental violations, severely punish enterprises' excess pollution, thereby protecting the environment and protecting the public health.
Now, for their own benefit, enterprises have increased their enthusiasm for treatment, cherishing limited emission rights and reducing pollutant emissions.
With the driving of economic benefits, the reduction of pollutant emissions from the government's compulsory behavior into an enterprise's conscious market behavior can truly achieve the purpose of protecting the environment, protecting nature and protecting the public health.
The right to discharge is also known as "emission rights," which is the right to discharge pollutants, and refers to the right to discharge pollutants to the environment according to law within the quota allocated by the government.
This right is, in essence, the right of the polluter to occupy, use and benefit from environmental capacity resources.
The next step is that, on the premise that the total amount of pollutant emissions does not exceed the allowable emissions, the amount of pollutant discharge through the exchange of money between the various sources of pollution is transferred.
The decontamination rights deal, which began in 1968 by American economist Charles Davis, began in the 1970s to apply it to the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources.
China has started a pilot project in 2007, and there are now 14 provinces (districts and municipalities) in Zhejiang and Jiangsu.

On February 22 this year, the United States and Russia reached an agreement on a ceasefire between the parties to the conflict in Syria, which began on August 27th.
According to the agreement, the ceasefire does not include a military strike against the terrorist groups identified by the United Nations Security Council, such as the "Islamic State."
Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure at the base, and the living conditions of Russian military personnel will also be protected accordingly.
He also said that if there were no strikes against extremist forces, those forces would extend to Russia.
While Russia and the West have not reached an agreement on a joint crackdown on extremist forces, Russia will strengthen its cooperation with Syria, Iran and Iraq in this regard.
In September 2015, Russia, at the invitation of the Syrian government, began a military strike against Syrian extremist forces.
On March 15 this year, Russia's main military force in Syria began to withdraw, but the Russian side pledged to maintain its presence in the hermim air force base and the naval base in Tartus.

In fact, the relationship between the village and the city should be with each other, just like the mother and the child, there is no weak points, no need to rule who, it should be very warm.
There is no fixed pattern for rural development, but the spontaneous change in the countryside is difficult, and the most important point should be to let the people go to the countryside.
The Shanghai Songjiang District Management Department recently used electronic police to control the driver to drive a mobile phone, with more than 30 seizures a week.
With the popularity of smartphones, mobile phones are becoming more and more fun, with microcredit, microblogging and even playing games, shopping for Taobao, and many people seem to have to leave their mobile phones and never stop driving.
The road traffic safety Act expressly prohibits the use of mobile phones and defines it as "preventing safe driving behavior."
It is regrettable that this phenomenon has not been punished as a result of the illegal public and the evidentiary difficulties, and the legal provisions have become almost set.
If the administration is determined to use the mobile phone as a "declaration of war," to normalize this measure, such violations can be curbed.
To close the records management of the household, it is necessary to establish electronic and paper files to ensure the integrity of the archives.

Last year, the village income of Donglin village reached 22 million yuan, which accounted for nearly half of the total agricultural income.
The village secretary, Su Zifang: The per capita land cultivation area is increasing every year, at the beginning of the 50 mu, now more than 100 mu, which is increasing every year, and the income of professional farmers is increasing every year.
By quantifying the shares to every villager, the biggest bright spot of rural collective economic reform in Suriname is to clear the rural collective property rights and explore the separation of politics.
In July 2015, 14 rural economic cooperation organizations and village committees in Xishan District, Wuxi, were responsible for the management of rural public affairs.
Two institutions, two accounts, do not "partner" to prevent village cadres from participating in collective asset management and corruption.
The deputy director of the Jiangsu provincial Agriculture Commission said that the next step in Jiangsu will continue to promote the reform of community joint-stock cooperation system, encourage farmers to jointly develop and establish a mechanism for democratic power running at the village level.
Wish peace: Further push the reform forward, engage in community equity cooperation, quantify the assets to the community, fixed to the farmers, and form a clear property rights.
Through Internet+, the implementation of his right to information, the right to participate in decision-making and the supervision of democratic management, the three rights are implemented to the farmers, and it does make it the operational mechanism of the regulated shares cooperation.
At present, the new collective economy in Suriname mainly forms the asset leasing type, the Enterprise stock type, the agricultural hair style, the joint development model.

Xiamen girl Zhang Binbin: "Handcrafted beautiful" start shooting career several "reverse"
Zhang Donghong, an Eastern Park Village in Xiamen, has just put 29 inches of old TV in his home a few days ago.
The daughter of the ordinary farmer, on the night of 11th, won a silver medal for the women's 50m rifle 3 at the women's 50m Rifle final in China.
On the night of the night, just before the new TV, Zhang Dong red couple and dozens of relatives and friends, together with dozens of relatives and friends, have seen their daughter go all the way, and have been eliminated from the almost preliminaries to the magical process of being reversed.
On the same day, Zhang bingbin was in the middle and downstream, and seemed to be far away from the final.
But the parents and family and friends did not give up, continue to brush the text live, and see that as the other runners finish, Zhang has been promoted all the way, finally locked in the final seat, and his home suddenly erupted in cheers.
In the final, Zhang bingbin was again on the back of the position, the last few shots, the more stable, only the backward champion 0.2 ring achievement to win the silver medal.
Zhang was 27 years old this year, and in the 16 years of shooting, in fact, there was a lot of difference with this hard-won silver medal.
Her mother Zhang Xiaolong told reporters, just as they hesitated, Zhang bingbin found a few "small lobbyists" from the same village.
These "small lobbyists" were also recommended to participate in the training of the same village children, including Zhang bingbin's cousin.
Shortly after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang bingbin, once again because of family difficulties and other reasons, volunteered to go back to the school.
But after his Enlightenment coach Zhang Yajie repeated his work, Zhang Binbin returned to Xiamen.
After entering the provincial team, Zhang bingbin, once again in the absence of the national team, once again returned home because of the lack of hope.
This time, not only Zhang Yajie coach, Xiamen shooting archery Center and UNK provincial leaders and coaches came to the house, and finally persuaded him to return to the provincial team.
Just as yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl insisted on a reversal on the road to the shooting.
"The way for every coach to pick a player is not the same, when I saw that it was very beautiful, and it was in the middle of it."
Zhang Donghong also recalled that, in the training test, the daughter, although the result is not the best, but the number of rings is stable, which is also an important reason for Zhang bingbin to attract coaches.
In the course of training Zhang bingbin, Zhang Yajie is most impressed by the peasant girl's input.
He recalled that Zhang bingbin entered the Xiamen shooting team for more than a year after a sustained gun training, which required the players to be unable to move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter has always been a quiet and gentle child, like painting and homemade handmade toys since childhood,
"I would have been making clothes and sewing in my home, and I would pick up some of the corners to make a doll."
She said that her daughter often makes handmade toys by herself, adding that she is good at drawing, and from the doll's hardware to clothing, she can always be very lifelike.
As an athlete, Zhang bingbin and his family get together more and more, only holidays will be able to go home, usually by telephone contact.
Parents say, whether it be the meeting or the phone, Zhang bingbin rarely says his hard work, more is to talk to his parents about happy things.
Usually do not see the daughter, the parents in the home to bring their daughter as a child, as well as the years of Honor have been carefully collected.
Zhang Xiaolong showed his daughter's cartoon to the reporter, "If there is no shooting athlete, she should continue to paint."
In Zhang bingbin's second floor living room, there is a cupboard filled with medals, medals and certificates.
Zhang Donghong placed the medal and the medal neatly, and the certificate was placed in the folder. "These are the honors that have been exchanged for more than a decade and we all cherish it."
Recently, the filial filial fund in Hebei province sent 16 000 yuan of consolation money to small works, Taiwan heads, Guiquan and other villages.
This is another outpouring of sympathy after the fund has sent a message to society for the "7.19 flood of young children and lonely old people."

According to the Hong Kong Oriental Daily reported on August 12, there are currently three major problems in the sale of diamonds in the mainland, including the fact that the net value of the virtual diamond is pushing up the price, the nominal diamond weight, the after-sale insecurity, etc.
While Antwerp is one of the world's biggest diamond trading centers, the local craftsman's diamond cutting technology is well known, and the diamonds sold have been strictly identified and welcomed by the mainland ladies.
"A small cloth bag, held in the palm of the hand, a small handful of light floating, worth nearly a million yuan," a Liu, who was involved in the purchase of diamonds, told the mainland media about her experience in Antwerp in June this year.
She said she hid the diamonds in her underwear, went to the toilet for a few days, took a bath, and went to sleep very nervous.
She said that on the diamond purchased at Antwerp, the purchase price was about five thousand dollars per carat, and the same quality of the diamond in Xiamen was about $111,000.
She recently bought two pieces of the purchase price, sold all the purchased diamonds, and made a profit of 200,000 yuan.
According to the customs regulations of the mainland, diamonds are not the goods or necessities of the journey. Therefore, they belong to the category of goods, they need to be declared at the time of entry and exit, otherwise they may be jailed.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will spend the summer holidays in Switzerland, but did not disclose a specific vacation spot, according to foreign media.
According to the media, after Brexit, the UK's new Prime Minister has opted for a "neutral" Swiss holiday on the continent, with some policy symbolic.
The British Guardian commented that the symbolic representation of the neutral country of Switzerland has played a role in the choice of the British prime minister's first resort.
The British daily Telegraph commented that Theresa May has opted for a holiday in Switzerland, after Mrs. Thatcher, the first British prime minister to go on holiday in Switzerland.

China's Mars program is here
China's Mars exploration mission is to achieve a circular, landing and tour, which has never been abroad.
The goal of the Mars exploration launch in our country is to look around, land and patrol, and this task is quite difficult.
Because the Mars probe will take 26 months to meet a time window, experts are working closely on the project to launch our first Mars probe in 2020.
According to Xu Dazhe, although our aircraft has entered the deep space, the completion of the Mars exploration mission is still indispensable, and the detection of Mars means that China has entered the era of deep space exploration.
"Every two or three years, there is a chance that Mars is closest to Earth, to launch a Mars probe at this point of time, which is the most provincial energy for the launch vehicle."
"Considering the quality of the Mars probe, the launch mission will be completed by China's Long March 5 carrier rocket."
Our country's Mars exploration mission is to achieve a circular, landing and patrol, which has never been abroad, and it has been proposed to achieve a circle and land once, but the landing failed.
There are very many technical areas involved in the exploration of Mars, in particular, although the Mars vehicle is a space probe, but it has a distinctive feature compared to the general space probe.
In other words, the Mars probe will have the ability to determine the route and detect obstacles.
Peng Hao, a research fellow at the China Aerospace Science and Technology Group, said that humans have been so popular with Mars because it has important scientific, technical and other significance, even to the future of mankind.
At present, Mars has become the planet with the highest degree of human research beyond the Earth, and the history of the exploration of Mars by human use of space probes is almost the entire history of human space.
As a result, mankind hopes to build a residential base on Mars one day and eventually migrate to Mars and turn it into a second home.
A large number of indications also suggest that Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth, only after billions of years of evolution into a thin atmosphere, low temperature, water depletion, etc.
Therefore, the exploration or manned landing on Mars can provide a plan to prevent the Earth from becoming the second planet to survive.
As of June 2016, a total of 114 lunar exploration has been conducted worldwide, 43 Mars exploration.
However, from the 1990s to the present, a total of 18 Mars exploration has been carried out, while the lunar exploration has been conducted only 14 times.
There are currently five Mars orbiter and two Mars rover at work, but only one moon orbiter and a lunar lander are working.
The world's space powers have developed a plan to target the Mars system, so that today's Mars exploration is hotter than the moon.
On November 5, 2013, India launched its first Mars probe, "Manhattan," becoming the first Asian country to successfully explore Mars.
"Managari" is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars, exploring whether there are methane and signs of life on Mars.
The hardest part of this mission is that it is only one chance for the probe to enter the atmosphere of the Martian atmosphere and the parachute deceleration
The Mars exploration mission faces a number of technical challenges, according to the director of the Mars probe in the General Department of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.
The atmospheric pressure on Mars is very low, with only 1% of the atmospheric pressure on Earth's surface, with a high degree of uncertainty.
The scientists did not have a thorough understanding of the changes and the characteristics of the storm.
Mars often forms a dust storm similar to the dust of the Earth in the summer, which will lead to a sharp drop in the sun's energy and the need to design a "dormant" mode for the Mars vehicle to wait patiently for the dust.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reduced effect on solar light, which poses a problem for the energy supply of Mars.
This requires the probe's solar wing to be larger, and it needs to be constantly adjusted to try to align the sun.
In addition, the surface gravity of Mars is only 38% of the Earth, but it is much larger than the surface of the moon, so the probe needs more power.
"The core and hardest part of the Mars exploration mission is the process of moving the probe into the atmosphere of the Martian atmosphere and the deceleration of the parachute, with only one chance to ensure success."
Sun Zemin said that because of the distance between Earth and Mars, the entire process cannot be controlled by the ground in real time, so it is necessary to rely on the probe to complete it.
Because there are not so many propellants to offset the high speed, when landing on Mars, deceleration depends on the role of Mars' atmosphere, but the Martian atmosphere is difficult to simulate on the ground.
He said that in general, the way to detect Mars is similar to the way to detect the moon, but also to "go around, fall, patrol and return," and eventually achieve the goal of manned landing on Mars.
Because Mars is much farther away from Earth than the moon, the detection of Mars requires a series of more sophisticated technical difficulties.
According to Taiwanese media, "the governor of the administrative court" announced yesterday morning that "the political parties and their accompanying organizations improperly obtained property handling regulations" came into effect today.
The vice president of the Kuomintang, said that "the Kuomintang, which has a history of more than one hundred years, has the commitment and responsibility of society, so it will not fail."
The Committee stresses that, if the political parties, the accompanying organization or the trustee are subject to the prohibition of punishment in violation of the regulations, the Commission will investigate and "punish" according to the terms of reference.
Lin has also announced the election of the deputy head of the labor committee, which will be chaired by the deputy director of the ICAC.
He said that it would serve as a basis for the Commission to clean up the cases of inappropriate party cases in the past, using the experience of Mr. Huntsman to check the relevant major cases.
He believes that today, as long as there is a party production, no one will give you social contributions, and if the party's production is confiscated, the Kuomintang can ask for social support and sponsorship, "Today is really not a chance to go."
He also stressed that the Kuomintang party has not been fully confiscated and confiscated after the failure of the party's labor regulations, and the remaining will be pledged to leave the party to zero, and the party wants everything from scratch.
Original title: "Corridor doctor" langyufeng v. CCTV host Wang Zhian honour infringement of first instance defeat
The Legal Evening News was told by CCTV host Wang Zhi'an on the new wave microblog about the events of the "corridor doctor," which brought Wang Zhi'an and Beijing microdream Innovation Network Technology Co., Ltd. to the court.
Yesterday afternoon, the Haidian court handed down a verdict on the case, which found that Wang Zhi'an and the microdream company did not constitute a violation and rejected all the claims of the Lantau.
In early 2014, the CCTV reporter Wang Zhian investigation found that despite the fact that more than 600 days of orchid in the hospital corridor were shaped by the media as a tragic hero of the system, there was a lot of false information.
On March 29 2014, the CCTV news survey produced "corridor doctor" broadcast.
There is no evidence to support the various so-called over-medical information reported to the media.
Wang Zhi'an, also in the real name of the microblog, describes the "orchid peak has come to this step is character, with obvious bias personality, etc."
Langfeng filed a request for Wang Zhi'an to remove Weibo, apologize to him and compensate for the mental damage of $100,000.
At the time of the trial, the two sides held a debate on whether Wang Zhi'an violated the reputation of Lantau.

The bicycle is expected to achieve a "zero breakthrough" for the Olympic gold medal, and the girl girl will challenge the two world champions Germany and expect the blast to burst into the top four.
The Royal town has been prominent in the past two seasons, with a silver medal at the World Championships in Beijing last year, and in May this year, the group went to the world championships to upgrade the individual title.
According to foreign media, the 27-year-old Korean archery actress Zhang hujan won a gold medal in the women's archery individual race and won the gold medal in the Olympic Games after the reunion, becoming a double crown.
Zhang, who is believed to be an accomplished player, regretted not getting the tickets for the previous London Olympics, but now proudly stands at the highest podium of the Rio Olympics.
Ms. Zhang, who won the gold medal in the women's archery individual final in the Brazilian road sports stadium in Brazil, won a gold medal in the final.
She made her first shot in the fourth grade of primary school, until she was 27, who won an individual gold medal for the first time in the World Cup in 2014, and was a late winner.
Zhang Hui recalled, "there was no level in the upper secondary school, so there was no way to compete in the country.
Zhang, who won only fourth place in the London Olympic Games four years ago, missed the Olympic tickets and was only able to take two gold medals at the same time as his friend and friend.
Zhang, who spoke at the end of the women's archery individual event at the end of the award ceremony, said that "until the last thing is to shoot an arrow as soon as possible, it may be a good result and contented.
The 28-year-old South Korean archery "sister," the London Olympic archery individual gold medal winner, has won a bronze medal.
Chifu, who lost to Zhang Hui in the semifinals, competed for a bronze medal with Mexican player Adam de la Valencia.
Chifu doubles in ensuring the bronze medal after tears in the field, in the silence of the golden burden is conceivable.
The first is that the coaching team has accumulated rich experience in continuous research, followed by scientific training methods, which need to be accumulated over the long term.
The archery team used military training, night through the cemetery and other methods to help the players to focus and stay calm.
Although it has not been confirmed, many sources have said that Apple's 2016 autumn conference will be held in September, and iPhone 7 is really coming.
Although Apple did not respond, the functionality and configuration of the new iPhone has been released, and even the iPod 7 "real machine model" Picture is available online.
The new generation of iPhone is "all attention," hot, tight and rich... If you want to buy positive products for the first time, you have to choose a good channel, for example, Suining.
This adds to the disappointment of the new cell phone, "it lengthens, but does not shoot holographic images! This generation of iPhone is terrible."
iPhone 7, like any other iPhone, was accompanied by countless secrets before birth.
In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will cancel the 3.5mm headset interface, switching to the Bluetooth connection and charging interface, which will provide space for Apple to add a second loudspeaker.
Another evidence to support the news is that, as early as 2014, Apple allowed headset manufacturers to produce headset products connected to the charging interface.
The news is true or false, and the answer will not be unveiled until Apple 2016.
But this does not prevent insiders from looking at the prospect of the iPhone 7, which many believe is likely to be the last major upgrade to Apple's iPhone series.
Despite recent data from market research firm IDC, the market share of the iPhone has declined.
Among them, Goldman has maintained a "buy" rating on Apple's stock, while its analysts believe that I 7 will reap a historic sales achievement.
At the same time, the company's ce Hock Tan also said that Apple's future revenue growth will likely exceed 20%, thanks entirely to the launch of iPhone 7.
Seven percent of the respondents said they had plans to buy iPhone 7, compared with only 4 percent of the planned purchase of iPhone 6 two years ago.
It is understood that 20 percent of the user groups currently holding iPhone6 or 6Plus are planning to purchase iPhone 7, which is a fairly high proportion.
Secondly, there is an expert analysis, and most of the fruit powder likes to replace their own iPhone.
According to statistics, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their mobile phone for two years, and the iPhone for almost 120 million users has been used for two years.
The media said that during the production of iPhone 7, Taiwan suffered several earthquakes, "the extent of the damage to the power production facilities is beyond the imagination and is likely to have an impact on the initial iPhone 7 supply."
The contradiction between supply and demand can affect the average user, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time low prices to start the original article 7.
According to people familiar with the matter, Suen met with Apple in the near term, with the aim of preparing adequate supplies.
The operator has talked with Suining, and it is foreseeable that, with the depth of cooperation between the two sides, it will inevitably bring lower prices and more intimate service to users.
"The lowest price, the consumer may have just seven yuan a day, you can buy iPhone 7."
A sufficient supply of goods and a variety of preferences, let the purchase of iPhone 7 no longer "pressure mountain," and Su Ning's logistics, more will turn this beautiful into a more intuitive sense of experience.
Perhaps, you will get a call in the middle of the night, "Hello, Sue is easy to buy, and your iPod 7 is here."
The organizers hope that through the cultural heritage exhibition, the local people will learn more about the long history of Chinese culture, thus enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.

According to foreign media reports, because of the diving pool water from the blue to green, the Rio Olympics "green pool" incident has been under the spotlight recently.
However, on the morning of October 10th, the water from the water polo pool adjacent to the diving pool turned green.
Australian water polo player said he felt a sharp pain in his eyes and wanted to shed tears.
Previously, officials in the Rio Olympics confirmed the green condition of the pool and said that the color of the water was due to the weak alkaline, which would not affect the health of the athletes.
But Australian athletes, after winning the game with the Japanese team in the water polo pool, said the eyes were stinging.
After the water turned green in the diving pool, the competition organizers worked overtime to deal with the diving pool on the evening of 9th, but found that the color of the pool also changed rapidly in the morning of the 10thth.
During the match between Australia and Japan, the environmental conditions of the pool were gradually deteriorating, but officials stressed that they would return the water quality of the two pools to their original color on November 11th.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the Rio Olympics, said: "Yesterday afternoon, the water level in the diving pool was initially weakened."
"We learned a series of reasons that could trigger the color of the water and the alkalinity of the water."
The water sports center conducted a series of tests on water quality, with hundreds of divers and swimmers using the pool to determine the quality of water quality. "
"We have been going through the normal procedure these days, but we may have overlooked the impact that the more athletes may have on water quality."
"But the change in water color will definitely have no effect on the health of the body, especially for athletes."
"This independent team has confirmed our assessment and confirmed the measures we have taken to restore the pool to normal color and normal chemistry."
"We had hoped that the pool would return to normal in the morning, but the pace of recovery was affected by the rain."
According to Taiwan's "central society," there was an explosion in a prison on the outskirts of the grand Manila region yesterday night, which resulted in the injury of the warden and the death of 10 prisoners, including two Chinese.

At present, Xinjiang has entered the peak of the tourist season, in order to standardize the market operation of the tourist market, and the law enforcement team of the Joint Municipal Transportation Administration Bureau of Urumqi is not the norm for the tourist vehicles that exist in the retail market yesterday, and the travel agency and the tourist have signed a low contract rate.
At eight o'clock yesterday morning, around 10 buses filled with tourists were parked around the karbinsky hotel, most of which were scattered around the Tianchi day tour.
"Hello, I am Urumqi Tourism Bureau, and you signed a contract with this travel agency?"
"The shuttle bus also has a shuttle bus in the Urumqi market to operate a tourist passenger project, and there is no qualification for it," said Yu Bin, a staff member of the law enforcement detachment of the Urumqi city transport authority.
"Superscope operates a fine of three to one hundred thousand for this penalty, and the driver does not have the qualification certificate of 2000 yuan."
It is understood that the former Urumqi tourism law enforcement department has carried out inspections in places such as West Park, Hongshan and other tourist destinations.
"The first is safety, the second is the norm, the travel vehicle is no small matter, and once the problem is the death of a group of injured people," said Ma Qi, deputy chief of tourism law enforcement detachment of Urumqi.
"We and the carrier jointly continue to inspect the market and regulate the travel of travel agents to ensure the safety of tourists."
On the morning of August 12, the information office of the State Council held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016.
A spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics and the director of the national economic statistics division said that in July the growth of some indicators of the national economy had slowed, but it was still operating in a reasonable range.
According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, there has been a decline in the growth of fixed asset investment and total imports in July.
The company said that with regard to the operation of the national economy in July, I would like to borrow a quote from the prime minister that "the shape is volatile and the momentum is still good," which can provide a better overview of the characteristics of the economy in July.
He explained that "the fluctuation of the shape" means that the growth of some of the economic indicators in July has actually fallen.
Because the economy is still in deep adjustment at home and abroad in July, the international situation is complicated and changeable, and the recovery of the world economy is less than expected, so the export pressure is still relatively large.
From the domestic situation, the economy is still in the critical phase of adjustment, the adjustment of the pain in the release, the economy is facing a small downward pressure, so some of the indicators have fluctuated.
The company noted that there was a special case in July, where floods were more severe and the high temperature and heat weather had some impact on the production and operation of some areas.
According to the recent release of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people in the country have been affected, with direct economic losses of more than 200 billion yuan.
In terms of industry, investment and transport related indicators, these regions are affected by varying degrees.
The volume of cargo turnover in July was 3.6 percentage points lower than last month, and the floods have had a certain impact on traffic in these areas.
In view of these factors, the fluctuation of some of the indicators in July is also normal, as well as expected.
"The trend is still good," he said, referring to the slowdown in economic growth, but the overall stability of the economy has not changed.
In July, the CPI rose 1.8 percent, and the ring rose 0.2 percent, and the CPI rose 2.1 percent in July, so the price situation was generally stable.
According to the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau portal, according to the statistics of high temperature weather in the districts, in addition to Yang Yang, the rest of the city can receive varying degrees of high temperature allowance.
Currently, at least 28 provinces in the country have made clear the criteria for granting subsidies, although the standards issued by the provinces are not the same, while Chongqing receives a high temperature allowance at high temperature workday allowance.
They shall be issued on a daily basis of not less than 10 yuan per person per day; they shall be issued on a daily basis of not less than 15 yuan per person per day.
More than 40 degrees above the high temperature staff can receive a maximum of 20 Yuan / day allowance per month (except for workers who have enjoyed a high temperature job allowance in accordance with the law).
According to this standard, the largest number of days of high temperature weather last month reached 330 yuan, while the lowest number of days was 80 yuan, while the highest temperature in the sun was not up to the high temperature standard, so there was no high temperature allowance.
In the past, many units will rush to the high temperature allowance with cool drinks, the City Safety Bureau said that this kind of behavior is not in accordance with the current method.
The employing unit shall not deduct or reduce the wages of the workers due to the cessation of work and the reduction of working hours due to high temperatures.
According to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, employees, who have not received a high temperature allowance at high temperature, may seek legal rights and interests through the labor dispute mediation bodies of the enterprise, or dial 12333 complaints.
If the employer refuses to grant a high temperature allowance, the worker may lodge a complaint with the competent department of human resources Social Security at or above the county level.
At the same time, because the high temperature allowance is part of the salary, not welfare, it should be included in the total salary, deduction of tax.
Therefore, the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage, must be paid in the form of cash, and cannot be substituted in kind, such as drinks.

The official operation of the new passenger station in Urumqi will become an important platform for Xinjiang to build a national integrated transportation city to promote the "Silk Road economic belt" and the construction of the new area.
Greg is a budding female giant beak, with the smell of tropical rainforest.
In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the giant mouth bird greesia and its story have long been a household name.
At a press conference on August 10, Greg Garcia, recovering from surgery, appeared to show people its brand new 3D print plastic bird beak.
It was only a year and a half ago when people broke the beak, the dying giant beak, and now it has been reborn.
This day not only announced that it was 100% restored to health, but also the day when it moved into the luxury birdhouse and met with the human friends who cared about it.
Grecian, who first entered the new home, was slightly shy, but soon became lively, rolling in the water basin, eating grapes with a new beak.
To remind people of the damage it has suffered, the technician did not colour its new beak, but retained the original White of 3D printing materials.
The bird's beak is a thin layer of cortical sheath, which is hollow inside, and only a few fine bone support rods are arranged.
Despite this internal reinforcement, the bird's beak is still fragile and can be broken when it hurts.
The animal rescue center, the bird anthropologist and a 3D printing company in the United States worked together to make a number of "test beaks" for Guerrero and finally made the "perfect beak" for it.
Today, Gregory has been able to use his new beak to drink water, eat, and even pick up small grains.
"The final product is designed for about two months, printing out just four or five hours."
"3D printing is not the technology of the future, and it is actually going into your life," Thomas langger, chairman of the US sg3d printing company, said in an interview with Xinhua International.
In January 2015, a farm in Grasia, central aura, in central Costa Rica, was found in the blood of a giant beak, greesia.
At that time, its beak was brutally broken by a group of young people, it was completely unable to eat and life was in danger.
After the tragic media coverage of greesia, there was a wave of opposition to the abuse of animals, both inside and outside Costa Rica.
People are calling for more stringent animal protection laws and greater penalties for abusers.
People have come forward to do their utmost to help Grecia to recover as much as possible before the injury.
Even 3D printing technology inventor Chuck Hull has also been involved in the design of Grecian's beak.
"Greg's situation is very special, and its upper beak is less than 1 centimeter, so there are many difficulties for installing a new beak."
"We scanned the Grecia first, then designed and produced a longer prosthesis that was slightly longer than the rest of its beak, with sticky glue fixed on its upper beak."
"This can reduce the risk of further invasive sexual harm to Guerrero," langger told Xinhua news agency.
Prior to the installation of the prosthesis, staff members were required to clean up their beak every day to prevent infection.
Thousands of miles away, the story of the giant mouth bird greesia moved the famous documentary director Paula eredia and the discovery of the News Channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded a slight drop in the process of installing a new beak in Guerrero, recording a documentary "giant beak bird," which was broadcast on the Animal Planet channel this month.
The documentary, the country of the giant mouth bird, shows people how to make a country change, how to allow its citizens to participate in the fight against the abuse of animals.
Core Tip: Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of China's small independent refinery, known as the teapot.
According to media reported on August 12, Japan's largest oil company, JX Energy, believes that "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the market downturn.
Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of China's small independent refinery, known as the teapot.
The quality of China's oil products is gradually approaching Japan's oil products because of the Chinese government's efforts to strengthen environmental regulations.
Prior to obtaining the import license for crude oil, the "teapot refinery" generally refined the heavy oil that imports sulphur content from Russia and other places.
The production of petroleum products with high sulfur content, poor oil products, has become one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining the import license of crude oil, the "tea pot refinery" was able to import the low sulfur content of Oman and Russian crude oil, and the quality of its petroleum products also increased.
The company said that "with the continuous improvement of the quality standards of petroleum products in China, the capacity of refining equipment has also risen.
As a result, the quality of petroleum products exported from China has gradually reached the same level as Japan (the world's highest quality).
JX Energy said that "after the end of 2015, China began exporting high-quality light oil to Australia to compete with Japanese products in the Asian market.
While "Japan's high oil" is in the midst of a crisis, the response strategy of Japan's oil companies is only to "focus on the market and export to profitable areas."
Because of the impact of China's exports of petroleum products on the Asian market, the attention of the tea-pot refinery is getting higher and higher.
In 2016, the Yangzi Evening group Sunshine aid operation was launched on May 26, and after two months of registration, the total number of poor students applying for grants has reached more than 800 people.

UV radiation not only makes the students' skin black, more sunburn skin, how to allow the skin to pass the military training, not sunburn?
The sunscreen packaging is generally marked with SPF and PA, which means the sunscreen index, which is directed against UVB ultraviolet, and our common SPF index is 15, 30, 50, etc.
The product of the PA is directed at UVA, so the sunscreen will play a more effective role. In general, the strength of the PA is used + to indicate that more than one + indicates the effective protection time.
Oily skin should choose permeability strong water sunscreen products, sunscreen spray is also a good choice.
Dry skin should choose the cream of sunscreen, the neutral skin is generally not strict, the sensitive skin to wipe any maintenance products is a burden, it is recommended to choose pure physical sunscreen products.
Remember to apply sunscreen for half an hour in advance because it takes time for sunscreen products to fully penetrate the skin.
Military training is longer than the sun, sunscreen every two hours can have a lasting effect, do not be lazy.

Farmers who buy farm machinery during the exhibition will continue to implement a cumulative subsidy policy, with farmers buying up to 40% of the subsidy.
This exhibition meets the global investment fair, especially the invitation to the countries and target market countries along the "One Belt and One Road."
This exhibition will strive to complete 60 of China Merchants signing projects, the introduction of RMB 22 billion yuan, and the signing of more than 160 trade contracts, and the contract amount of 3.2 billion yuan.

On some nights, the ionosphere is full of free electrons, which means that the radio signals can go further.
The U.S. Air Force is interested in copying this effect, according to the American Journal of mass science on August 11.
While a steady stream of free electrons can help people listen to the radio on the edge of a university radio station, this may not be the interest of the US Air Force.
The ionosphere, full of electricity, means that the military's radio has a larger broadcast range, and it may provide some protection for the global positioning system (GPS) signal from the impact of solar storms.
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of cube satellites based on demand, which can strengthen the ionosphere when needed.
But first, the teams that have signed contracts with the Air Force must prove that the scientific principles will work.
According to industry data, the total capacity of coal production in 2015 is close to 6 billion tons, with a total of 1.8 billion tons of coal capacity.
In the past ten years, the State Council has issued a total of five notifications of eliminating excess and backward capacity.
Although the previous four failed to target the coal industry, the target industry has a direct relationship with the coal industry.
From November last year to January this year, the Qinhuangdao 500m power coal price has long been hovering at 370 yuan per ton, and 90% of the coal companies are in a loss.
Coal prices have risen steadily since February, while the price of power coal in the Qinhuangdao recently increased by four weeks, rising to a 16-month high, climbing to $436 per tonne, up nearly 70 yuan from the beginning of the year.
As the price picks up, there are concerns about the following: A batch of small coal mines will not resume production?
In this regard, the director of the economics of the Reform and Development Institute of China (Hainan) conducted an analysis and interpretation.
Xiangming: There is a high level of attention paid to the production capacity, and the report card of the coal industry that has been released today does make everyone feel more worried.
These three layers also reflect the reasons for the relative lag behind our growth patterns in the past, which has not yet been fundamentally transformed by the government-led growth.
Secondly, it is directly related to the advancement of the local government, and in the process of producing capacity, the funds and corresponding measures are to be put in place, and in this regard, the differences in different regions are indeed greater.
Third, if some provinces are slow to catch up in the second half of the year, they may face greater risks.
In this case, the process of relying on the central award to replace the production capacity could have a negative impact.
Firstly, the production capacity is not a simple total control.
Our aim is to promote the optimization of the structure and reconstruct the new state of the coal industry by eliminating backward production capacity.
In the process of deploying to capacity, the local government must combine the production capacity and the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry to develop related services.
Second, we need to give full play to the power of administrative supervision and administrative oversight in order to complete this year's capacity to produce this year.
Finally, we need to strengthen the role of social security.
Because the market is directly related to employment, we need to strengthen the employment skills training for employees and workers.
"The decline is due to the expected deterioration of foreign investment in Brazil's GDP growth in the medium term."
In 2015, Brazil's participation in global direct investment was 3.7 percent, down from 5.7 percent in 2014.
Credit Suisse's international investment attraction index includes four sub-indices: Infrastructure, economic outlook, business environment and direct investment.

Original title: Canadian police shot dead is supporters: A homemade bomb attack on the city in preparation for a close
The taxi company said the taxi was moved to Bradford's home before the police arrived.
In a press conference Wednesday, the Canadian police said the information received by the police included the "martyrdom video" provided by the FBI to carry out the attack on the youth.
According to the German voice, a man wearing a black Balak cap on the screen is reading the Koran, referring to crimes against Muslims and vowed to launch an attack on a Canadian city soon.
He said in the video that the attack would take place within 72 hours, and in the rush hour.
The incident was the first time the police had shot the terror suspects before the incident last year by the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Doherty.
After the upgrade, the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal branch line, the old Wanfu River, the North Dao channel, will collect tolls on September 1.
The two tributaries channel adopt social financing methods for renovation construction, and the fees have been approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government.
The old Wanfu river channel flows through Jinxiang, fish station, via Nanyang Lake into the main course of the Grand Canal, 32.5 kilometers.
According to the need of navigation, the old Wanfu river channel adopts the method of conservation and renovation, the local water depth is dug deep, the local sharp bend is made straight and so on, the conditions of navigation can be improved.
The channel flows through the Jinxian County and the City district, via Nanyang Lake into the main channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, 19 kilometers long.
The renovation of the two waterways commenced construction in February 2011 and completed the acceptance of the handover in January 2015, and the investment construction and operation subjects were the Anping canal logistics service center in Jining City.
According to the principle of "loan construction and loan repayment," the Anping canal Logistics Service Center of Jining City, according to the charging standard of the Shandong province price approval, collects the passage fees.
Among them, the basic tolls were collected at 1.75 yuan / weighing tons, and the mileage tolls were collected at 0.05 yuan / km.
The tolls will be collected from June 15 2016 to June 14 2019.
The reporter learned from the port of Jining city that there are currently a total of 4 toll lanes in Jining, respectively, the Zhangshui river channel, the Baima river channel, the North and the old Wanfu River.
Article 4 The channel is the tributary channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, which adopts the mode of social financing to upgrade.
The Su Shui river channel upgrade project is the first to adopt the "government + market" model, which is used in the project of the construction of the navigation infrastructure of the river port in Shandong province, with the government accounting for the main investment and the supplementary funding gap.
The main routes, such as the White Horse River, the old Wanfu River and the Beidao River, take the form of pure market operation.
The funds allocated by the state cannot meet the needs of the construction of the project, and restrict the progress of the channel upgrade.
The construction of social funds for public infrastructure is in line with the requirements of the national policy, as well as the way to crack the bottleneck.
Ning Zetao's performance in the 100-meter freestyle semi-final has left many Chinese viewers speechless.
But in the 50-meter freestyle, Ning Zetao once again refreshed people's "bottom line."
In fact, the 50-meter freestyle is not ningze Tao, his performance and the best in the world championships, also determined that he is unlikely to make a breakthrough in this project.
Sure enough, Hong Kong's authoritative media, the Gazette, revealed that the biggest reason for the loss of Lenin was that he had lost interest in swimming.
Many factors outside the field may have had a big impact on his thinking about the future, and he is now likely to be more interested in entering the entertainment circle.
After the Karshan world championships, ningztao, with its superior face value and good grades, instantly became the net red.
Therefore, the "national old public," "little meat," "Flower beautiful man" and other appellations also become his body label.
A variety of business activities come to the door, the good money, to become a golden light flashing Boulevard.
In this case, Ning Zetao, even if he chooses to retire into the entertainment circle at this time, is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly viable path.
After all, he is only 23 years old, and after a certain degree of study, he can play one or two TV dramas with his popularity.
But Ningzetao needs to see that, compared to these predecessors, is it sufficient qualification?
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Liu Xuan, 21, has come to the end of the athlete's career.
Liu Xuan's beautiful appearance made her quickly remembered and laid the foundation for her future foray into the entertainment industry.
After his retirement, Liu Xuan made a number of TV dramas and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tian Liang participated in the 10-meter race for the two Olympic Games and won two gold and two silver.
But after losing to teammate Hu Jia in the men's 10m platform in 2004, Tian Liang's competitive state slipped and was expelled from the diving team.
And he and his daughter in "dad to go" and other variety show, especially let him make his eye.
Once the gymnastics gold generation Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng, as well as Chen ice all high-profile participation in a variety of arts programs.
It is worth mentioning that Yang Wei Li, who led China to the 2008 Olympic men's championship, was twice taken to the individual all-around gold medal, known as the Almighty King.
Chen Bing, who led China to the 2012 Olympic team champion, also became King of the Rings.
However, after losing the gold medal in the Olympic Games in London, Chen's size of the move, also let him circle powder countless.
But the current main energy of these athletes is still in the game, and the variety show is just like the dragonwater to touch down.
But whether it is a retired or active athlete, the popularity of the entertainment industry needs to be guaranteed by the performance of the hand.
After all, athletes step into a new field, either the ability or the human vein, is a blank.
Even Tian Liang, Liu Xuan and so many years of "old people," the average audience raised them, more still think of their performance at the Olympic Games.
And Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and other new people, in the introduction of a variety show, no exception is "Olympic champion."
Compared to several people, Ning Zetao, a champion of the swimming world championships, is still a bit thin.
Moreover, compared to the achievements of Tian Liang, Liu Xuan, Yang Wei and others, ningztao in the age of 23, with a slight setback in his athletic career, the negative impact on his image is probably incalculable.
After all, the mention of athletes, people's demands are "do not seek a hundred victories, but do not fear hardship," ningztao is far worse than this.
Ten thousand steps to say, Ning Zetao is handsome, completely can rely on Yan value to obtain the support of thousands of brain residues.
Not a bit of power, only on the exterior, want to mix well in the entertainment circle, this difficulty is not better than a good training to recover the proper state.
The choice of life depends on the individual's will, but how to choose, ningztao should have a number.
On the surface, the online social platform expands the communication circle and reduces people's sense of loneliness.
The sphere of social networking has become more and more widespread, not only gradually replacing the traditional telephone contact, even infiltration into the real life circle online, quietly changing the social life of the people.
Online social benefits are obvious, such as convenience and fast, so it is particularly easy to be favored by young people.
According to a survey of social habits of college students, 57% of college students use their mobile phones for more than five hours a day, and the basic "machine does not leave."
"The social network has the characteristics of low cost, fast transmission and simultaneous communication, which is in line with the needs of contemporary college students."
The expansion of the human relationship circle, the more equitable dialogue and the avoidance of social concerns is the main reason for our increasingly deep love online chat.
People who have just entered the company love to communicate with their colleagues online, "because the unit is not very familiar, through the social platform's point of praise, the relationship is much closer than before."
Love Friends also used to communicate online, "before with friends because some misunderstandings have not been contacted for some time, then in a large group of dialogue a few words, then warm up."
Mr. Wu, an IT engineer, is a deep online social enthusiast, and most of his social life is on the line, and the number of online contacts is more than the number of friends in the line.
Wu said he also admitted to "fish in water" on the Internet.
"You can respond to your friends when you want to, because there is a lot of time to say, and the presentation will be clearer."
"Hidden in the ID of you to avoid face-to-face interpersonal collisions, there is not only room for manoeuvre, but even more time and space for thinking about words and deeds."
"People of different identities have the same rights and efficiency to speak, and social concerns in real life seem to be eliminated in cyberspace."
However, Wu's friend, Xiao Peng, thinks that Wu in life is a "very boring house man."
Xiao Peng and Wu spoke in a large group, because both were active speakers and soon became acquainted with them.
Xiao Peng feels that Wu is different from the network, the language is boring, and does not offer an opinion, it is a few words "Ha ha, OK, yes," or "I want to check on the Internet."

In northeast China, the Red List of endangered species of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) is listed as endangered (en).
According to the forestry department of Jilin province, the data from the joint monitoring of the United States and Russia in 1998 showed that there were only four to six Tigers in Jilin province, 3 to 5 in the northeast.
According to the director of the protection of the forestry department of Jilin province in Changchun, Jilin Province has been increasing the protection of wildlife in recent years, and the population of northeast and northeast leopard in China is growing significantly, and the distribution region has been expanding.
According to the latest monitoring data in 2015, only 27 of the Wild East Tigers are monitored in Jilin province alone.
As the world wildlife conservation flagship species distributed in the Sino-Russian border, the cooperation between China and Russia is significant for the recovery and reproduction of the Wild East tigers and leopards.
According to the forestry department of Jilin province, the Jilin province has established a long-term and stable cooperation mechanism with Russia.

Sun Fujian as a leading cadre of party members, the ideal belief loss, serious violations of the party's discipline, and the party's top ten is still not convergent, do not accept the hand, the top wind discipline, the nature is bad, the plot is serious.
After this case, after several media reports, became the focus case, the social impact is extremely bad.
In the aftermath of the case, the police chief of the Haikou public security bureau attached great importance to it, and immediately organized a team of elite police officers to carry out the investigation.
The police immediately ran the suspect on the Internet and took a variety of measures to control, and by contacting the police in the field to check the whereabouts of a country.
Since the suspect is a recidivist, has repeatedly been dealt with by the public security organ, has a strong anti-reconnaissance capability, combined with his long-term drug use, the interrogation of drug addiction is frequent, and it is very difficult.
The Greenland shark, also known as the small head sleeping shark, is widely distributed between Greenland and the North Atlantic ocean around Iceland, which is aged between 4 and 5 meters in adulthood.
But their growth is extremely slow, sometimes only about 1 cm in a year, suggesting that the Greenland shark may have an exceptionally long life.
Traditional methods of measurement usually use calcification of animals, and some sharks can use fin ridges, but this calcification group is very rare in the Greenland shark.
A new study led by Ulysses Nelson of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark turned to radioactive carbon dating from the eye lens of the Greenland shark.
This method had previously been used to determine the age of the whale, but it was the first time to determine the age of fish such as sharks.
Their analysis showed that the biggest shark life is estimated at 392, with an error of 120 years.
This means that the shark is at least 272 years old and is most likely to reach the age of 512.
In addition, the female Greenland shark is said to be able to mature about 4 metres in length, and that it is at least 156 years of age.
The researchers, therefore, wrote in the paper that the Greenland shark is known to the Earth, the oldest vertebrate, more than the previous long-lived champion Ridge whale (211).
Since one year, the transformation has been remarkable, the RMB exchange rate has remained basically stable, while also laying the foundation for promoting the internationalization of the renminbi.
According to the market performance, the exchange rate of RMB exchange rate is obvious in the past year, the exchange rate elasticity is strengthened, the exchange rate is expected to be stable.
Since the exchange rate has been changed to date, the fluctuation of the RMB against the United States dollar has repeatedly appeared, but the process has been replaced.
The last change measures before the "811" transfer last year were implemented in 2005, with a significant appreciation of the RMB against the US dollar over the past decade.
Since the introduction of the new remittance reform, the yuan has changed the state of appreciation before and about 8% of the value of the RMB exchange rate in the middle of the year.
On October 1 this year, the International Monetary Fund will formally accept the renminbi as the weighted currency of the SCR (special drawing rights).
According to statistics released by the China Customs administration this week, China's imports and exports totaled 13.21 trillion yuan in the first seven months of this year, down 3 percent from the same period last year.
In the month of July, China's import and export value declined by 0.9 percent year-on-year, in particular exports, which grew by 2.9 percent year on year.
According to relevant experts, although there are signs of stabilization in July, there should not be too high expectations.
In July, China's import and export value was 2.09 trillion yuan, down 0.9% year on year.
Among them, it exports 1.22 trillion yuan, an increase of 2.9 percent; imports 87 billion yuan, down 5.7 percent; and the trade surplus of 342.8 billion yuan, an increase of 34 percent.

Shanghai police arrested more than 3400 people in four months to crack down on "theft and deception" gang 157
At the same time, the police also paid a total of more than 3300 million yuan for stolen goods.
According to the members of the theft gang, they entered Shanghai from the field by way of a black car, followed by the car, and each of them joined the bus in a few hours later.
In the course of the crime, the criminal suspect often takes a building as a unit, using the exterior wall to climb, breaking the burglar window fence from the top to the "sweeping" theft.

The police reminded members of the public that it was necessary to lock the doors and windows of their homes when they went out, and suggested that the public should choose the hard steel.
In late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will go to Kenya to attend the sixth African development conference in late August, according to China's voice.
The African development conference was dominated by Japan, and the previous five meetings were held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, and the meeting will also be the first to move to Africa.
In this regard, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan said that a local meeting in Africa helped to attract the attention of Africa and Europe to Japan.
In a bid to coincide with Abe's visit, Japan's LDP will send its members to the countries concerned, according to the news agency.
Japan's "usual" route began in the early 1990s, and the African Development Conference, launched by Japan, began in 1993, which is no coincidence!
Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations, which is an important ticket to the United Nations, and Japan wants to "go to normal" and how will it abandon Africa?
It will also exchange views with national stakeholders on extremist groups "Islamic State" and "terrorist activities."
"The Western group" will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau.
Japan's Foreign Minister Tian Wenxiong recently described the intention of the African Development Conference at the UN Security Council.
Abe has announced in the past that, in order to stabilize the African countries south of the Sahara desert, it will provide 100 billion yen ($6.1 billion) of aid in five years.
Observers generally believe that Japan's generosity to Africa has been mainly for two purposes: One is to increase Japan's presence in Africa; and second, to win support from African countries on the issue.
"In terms of politics, Africa is lagging in relative development, but the number of countries is relatively high, so Japan has always regarded it as the so-called 'big ticket field'," said Yang Bojiang, an expert on Japan.
In the future, Japan will not give up, and the work of Africa will not be terminated, and will continue to strengthen.
On the economic front, because Japan's productive capacity is stronger, the domestic market is relatively limited, especially in the context of the current low aging population, domestic demand is relatively weak.
However, from Junichiro Koizumi, 10 years ago, to Abe, 10 years later, in the meantime, Japan has repeatedly launched into the "sprint," but all of them came back.
Japan's problem expert Yang Bojiang believes that Japan's usual intentions are clear, but the road is bound to be difficult.
In order to achieve its goals, Japan should first have a good relationship with the surrounding countries, in which Japan needs to have a correct attitude, regardless of geopolitical rivalries or ethnic disputes and historical awareness.

Traditional custom introduces the opening of the new bright spot "2016 Lantau Cultural Festival" Hong Kong Victoria Park
Beat the Drum music, the traditional snacks, the fancy decoration, the crowd surging scene.
The "2016 Valley culture festival," which is hosted by the Hong Kong tidal Community Association, is held at Victoria Park from 12th to 14th, which is one of Hong Kong's most grand flange wins.
In addition to the continuation of the "lone competition," there has also been an increase in the family's ability to participate in the "parent basin for the heap."
Not only to introduce the history of the Magnolia Culture in the form of comics, the site also features a 3D self-filming area, traditional snack area and traditional handicraft mobile classroom, which attracts many children and overseas visitors to experience the visit.
A couple from France stayed at the scene for nearly three hours, and had a bit of experience in the mini flower card mobile classroom.
"Check out this special holiday online, so decide to come and see and feel fresh."
They said that while there are similar celebrations in France, the atmosphere is heavy, unlike here, there are music and food can also learn traditional crafts.
She said, "in such a busy financial metropolis in Hong Kong, it is possible to see a ceremony of such a scale and organized worship of ancestors.
"This not only reflects the diversity of Chinese culture, but also allows more people to understand these traditional crafts and carry on."
"We do not want to place the Magnolia cultural festival so horrible that people are afraid to approach, especially children," Hu said.
"We want to give young people a sense of filial piety and gratitude through the activities and arrangements at the scene."
He also said that a total of 24 teams participated in "a lone competition," which included not only associations, but also cooperation with some schools to allow students to participate.
It is understood that the Hong Kong boomers will have been included in the "national intangible cultural heritage list" in 2011.
Late in the evening, the Chinese national capital theatre, the White Snake Pass, traveled thousands of miles to Mexico City, where the National Academy of Fine Arts presented an authentic Peking Opera feast for the local people.
As a key performance project for the "sino-la cultural exchange year," the Chinese national capital Theatre performed seven Peking Opera in five cities such as Mexico City, and Cordoba and Ciudad Juarez in August.
The audience followed the story of the "White Snake" plot, the actor's singing and playing, with a smile, and a warm ovation.
Mary sahmenniska, who had watched the performance of the Beijing Opera 15 years ago, accompanied her daughter to see the show.
"This is a brilliant performance, and music, lighting and stage performances have impressed me... I think it is necessary for my daughter to learn about Chinese culture and the Beijing Opera art."
The enthusiasm of the Mexican audience impressed the White Lady as a performer, as well as a young actor.
"I did not expect the Mexican audience to be so enthusiastic, and I had some concerns about their ability to understand the story, but today it is my surprise to see them capture the plot and a lot of laughter."
China's ambassador to Mexico, Qiu Xiaoqi, said that the cultural exchange activities of this year's "sino-la cultural exchange year" have played an active role in promoting understanding and enhancing friendship between the two peoples.
Next year is the forty-fifth anniversary of the diplomatic relations between China and Mexico, and more cultural exchanges will be held in China and Mexico.
Liu gives your visit to Sanya to study "double repair and double city" to raise the level of urban construction
On the morning of December 12th, Liu welcomed the convening of the symposium and listened to the report on the progress of the pilot work on "double city" in the city of Sanya and the suggestions of the relevant departments.
Liu has given full recognition of the results achieved during the pilot work and the good experience and good practices that have been created.
Liu has stressed that Sanya should seize the opportunity of historical development so as to play an important role in the pilot work of "double City" and to give full play to the leading role in the economic and social development of the province.
It is necessary to play a leading role in promoting the internationalization of the international tourism island, starting with the details of the dots, enriching international elements and creating international fine.
It is necessary to play a leading role in both urban and rural integration and the whole range of tourism, to speed up the construction of scenic towns and to integrate tourism elements into each project, and to build every village and town in Sanya.
To play a leading role in the "act of social investment in services," promote a number of major projects and the construction of the park, ensure the landing of high quality projects and implement the requirements of the major operations.
Provincial Committee Standing Committee, Sanya municipal party secretary Zhang Qi, deputy governor Wang Lu, the provincial government Secretary General Lu Zhiyuan participated in the investigation.
Deng Yaping, who won 18 world titles in 14 years, became the first person to win four Olympic gold medals in the history of the Olympic Games.
She holds the world number one for eight consecutive years, and is the world's oldest female athlete in the history of table tennis.
On September 26, 2010, he was the Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Daily newspaper and the general manager of the people's search network Corporation.
Recently, she will work with Yu Zhihong to create the first domestic sports industry innovation and entrepreneurship platform.
In China, there are also such a group of star coaches: They have no limit at the time of the athletes' time, to win countless glory for the country; after retiring, they will teach them many years later, cultivating the champion.
As the first world champion of Chinese men's gymnastics, Huang Yu chose to pick up the whip after he retired.
From the women's coach to the men's coach, and then to the coach, huangyubin has built a "Olympic gold Corps," which has won nine gold and silver bronze in the Beijing Olympic Games.
Since then, Tian Liang has been advertising continuously, especially in recent years has played the "cowboy," "Lei Feng" and other important roles.
Many NBA players have proved their strength, but some progress has been declining.
Whether it is due to the increase in age or the time limit for appearances, there will be a setback for some players every season.
Of course, some "retreat" may be just the shrinkage of the data, and the strength of these players may not be reduced.
Even Wade is one of the best scoring defenders in the league, but his performance in the bull should not be as good as the heat.
He and Londo's post-field range is limited, and there are only 32.8% of the local star Butler's third hit, which puts them in a crowded attack next season.
Arriving in the wind city, the Lightning man is bound to give the ball more concessions to Butler and Londo, and he is likely to choose the regimen in the regular season.
Oliver's situation is more embarrassing, as the first choice of 76 last season, he had to compete with Simmons and UNK in the new season to compete with the ball.
The competition may not come soon, and Simmons will need to adapt to the NBA game, and enbide also wants to recover fully from the injury as soon as possible, but it is still a problem for him to have a seat in the 76.
Last season, he scored 32% of the scoring from a low offense, which is higher than UNK, UNK and Brooke Lopez, while at the same time his usage rate was 40 at the top of the league.
As Simmons has shown excellent control of the striker's potential, enbide also has a body that is better suited to the NBA, and the status of Ogilvy is unlikely to be so solid.
In the past two seasons, Thompson's usage has stabilized at the top 20 in the league, and this is the best two seasons of his career.
The problem, however, is that, with the arrival of Durant, Thompson's usage will certainly decline, which will certainly affect his performance.
This impact will not only be the impact of the number of times, but the game will certainly be greatly reduced in the next season, which in some ways will also make it harder for opponents to defend him.
The arrival of Durant will certainly shrink the numbers of the Warriors' players, but this is probably the worst case of Thompson.
But this does not mean that the level of soup is a step back, which is more like his sacrifice for the team as a whole.
Parker's performance in the last season was better than the data reflected, not only because his basketball was at the top of his career, and he and Aldrich's chemical reaction also benefited the Spurs.
Duncan retired, Kyrgyzstan declared another year of war, and the combination of GDP eventually came to an end, as the youngest of the three men, and there was not much oil in the tank of the French sports car.
After getting the third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell James won more regular season MVP, while Jordan was the only person to have won more than James.
Oh, yes, James just brought Cleveland for the first professional sports championship trophy in the past 52 years.
James, who has come to the 14th season of his career, needs a better guarantee of strength to prepare for the playoffs.
So, in the regular season, James's data is likely to fall further and he will share more of the burden on Owen, but he will still easily become the league's top three players.
"It is important to bring talent from home to Russia."

At the same time, the Secretary-General of the Russian Chinese Cultural Association, who participated in the training course, also felt the same.
She said she has made great progress with the help of the course teacher and also felt the burden of being a "Chinese cultural overseas communicator."
Yanwei said that after returning to Russia, he decided to spread and promote the Chinese traditional culture among the Chinese and the Russians who love Chinese culture.

The British team won silver in the Sevens rugby tournament, and Fiji won the gold medal
In the seven-man rugby final on Thursday night, the British team failed to perform well before the Fiji team, and was defeated by the Fiji team 43 to 7 in the Rio de Janeiro stadium.
The Fiji team won the gold medal with impeccable performance in the control of the ball, seizing, avoiding, matching, running and power, which is the country's first ever Olympic medal.
The silver medal was a small consolation for the defeated England team, which was the third silver medal that the British delegation won the same day, which was enough to make the British rugby team proud: They beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa all the way for the first time to enter the Olympic Games.
Earlier in the day, the British team won the South African team by 7 to 5, which may have affected their status in the final.
But in any case, the Fiji team is now enough to beat a team full of 15 people.
Tomorrow, at least one Englishman will wear a gold medal, which may be a comfort for the British team, but it may not be. The Englishman is Ben Ryan, a Fiji coach from Wimbledon, who served as head coach of the British team.
It is not easy for the British team to achieve their results today.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's coaching, they did not taste the winner at the international sevens rugby game in Adelaide.
And now, they are just one step away from the Championship.
Although they have suffered a huge blow, they have made remarkable progress.
Fiji took advantage of the opening game, making the British team defenseless.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it is like hitting a string of buses that are on the road, and the World Series champion team has been ahead of the World Series with a score of 5 to 0.
It was only four minutes after the game, and Jerry looked on the right flank.
12 to 0, England hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell's strength stopped the giant's General Lyon, without a third score, but it was merely delaying the speed of Fiji's score.
At seven minutes, Adam weslema touched the ground at the right corner. 17 to 0, England added Frost.
That Cara had one point, and the game..
Then, Walter Morales broke England's defense and went straight to the score line.
At halftime, the score was 29 to 0.
The Fijian people seem to have been born with seven people playing rugby, and the British team is still in its infancy.
That is exactly what happened.
The British team made a huge change in the second half and hit Fiji's defensive line for a full four minutes, and in the first half, the performance was good, but then the Fiji team played an excellent match, scoring again by Josh tuesova.
Dan Norton has created a scoring opportunity for the British team, he touched on the left corner and changed the score to 36 to 7, but the game was already in the grip of the South China Sea island, with their fans singing, waving flags and singing and dancing on the platform.
The impressive performance of the Fiji team had to be applauded.
Matthew Williams, at the last moment, prevented the Fiji team from doing so without a so-called attack.
The final whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced, and the defeated England could only regret the retreat.
Earlier in the day, the Fiji team defeated the Japanese team 20 to 5 in the semifinals, while the UK narrowly missed the South African team in a fierce semi-final.
In the first half, Kyle Brown helped the South African team lead, but Dan Norton scored in the second half with an excellent foot.
After that, England's Anthony's brother, Marcus Watson, secured the team's victory with a brilliant interception and eventually won the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning were inspired by the cancer coach who won the rowing gold
It is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the most touching gold.
From the beginning of the first paddle to the present, Helen Graf and Heather Stanning have received 220 punitive Rafah training, and the gold medal she won in Estacio da Lagoa has more extraordinary significance.
Although there were only two of them, the sound of one of the men's coaches, Robin Williams, continued to accompany them to the second consecutive women's doubles Olympic gold medal, which was the first in the UK to reach the height of the Rowing Women's portfolio.
They have maintained 39 unbeaten records and have an absolute advantage.
What we are seeing is that the two talented athletes are graceful on the surface, but this is not the whole story of this victory.
There was a lot of volunteer help behind each rowing gold medal, and it was their constant dedication to make a difference, and one of the greatest help was to know that he was suffering from cancer 30 months ago and did not know if he could live to see this day's coach.
As he said, death can come at any moment.
I suffered from bladder cancer and they underwent surgery for me.
If surgery is not performed, the cancer will spread throughout the body.
In this case, the situation will be much worse.
This will change your mind slightly.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he began treatment in early 2014, which will affect the lowest, although in this case it might not be appropriate.
I need to get my salary, so I have to hurry up.
It was an inspiration for me.
I live in a hospital, although they say a few steps will be enough, but I walk around 20 feet, 30 feet and 50 feet in the ward.
This is the starting point.
The rowing itself is a journey, which makes the journey a bit longer.
At the moment of the gold medal, they first thought of Williams, which was slightly more talkative than usual this morning to overcome his anxiety.
"I was in a bad mood this week and might have been a bit extreme, but the gold medal is really extraordinary," she said after being the captain of the Royal Artillery Corps.
It has repeatedly told me how important it is for me, I, Helen and Robin have made a lot of effort.
This is Helen, Robin and I have worked hard for three years.
If there is no Robin, we are just nameless and thank him very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I can't find a better trainer and coach than him.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not suffered defeat in five years.
The punishment imposed by the combination is not comparable to their opponents.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand team and the Danish team began to close, Stanning and Graf still had plenty of physical reserves.
It was really exciting.
Helen shouted: "Keep pace and keep pace."
It's really important not to be influenced by your opponent.
We have a good start, and at the same time we are not looking forward to doing something amazing.
We didn't think of today's glory, we just want to make every paddle and win this game, and we did it.
The pair took a year to determine their own future.
Graf will be married with TV explorer Steve Bakar next month.
But for now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don't want to say this is my last game.
This will bring me too much pressure.
In London, it took me about six months to realise I was an Olympic champion.
This is an entirely new experience, and I feel very nervous.
It has now lasted about four minutes.
She said: "I feel much better."

Bulgaria's inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that the monthly inflation rate of Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest rate of inflation for several years (since June 2012), after the first breakthrough in the inflation rate since last October (0.2% inflation).
Compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015), the average annual inflation rate (measured by the consumer price index) for the past 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) - 0.8%.
Compared to June 2016, the consumer price index for July 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation rate of 1.0%.
The rate of inflation this year (July 2016 relative to December 2015) is 0.2%. Compared to July 2015, the annual rate of inflation in July 2016 was 0.2%.
Compared to last month, the prices of the following categories of consumer goods rose in July 2016: Food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), traffic (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
There was a decline in the prices of clothing and footwear (2.2 percent), furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5 percent), medical (0.1 percent).
There were alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education last month.
The "animation" effect of the "cartoon" is used to refer to Asian people
He said the filter was inspired by the idea, but some observers thought it was racist.
The 150 million daily users can change the reality through their filter tools and make people look ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a roili hezstein painting.
These lenses have the effect of passivation and bending characteristics, producing more than 30 million copies each day after modification.
Any error will be immediately noticed by the public.
The lens has been criticized for being encouraged to play black or white skin.
So when the app provides a filter for some users this week to create a squint, blame tooth and pink face effect, some critics call it a racial irony of the Asian "yellow race."
They even think that these recurring problems mean that the company has a bigger problem with diversity.
After saying that it had deleted the function, the report on Wednesday's verge and whiteboard sparked outrage.
The company explained that the filter is a tribute to the cartoon character, not the irony of Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of the damaging stereotype of the reality.
Others are also strongly opposed to these animated images.
A Twitter and widely shared Korean American art student said in an email that the filters were "at least uncomfortable and uncomfortable.
She also said: "It is difficult to distinguish between the extremely disgusting Asian caricature and the effect of the filter."
Although the filter is not only the yellow people, but the yellow people are extremely demeaning.
This is not the only company that touches the bottom line.
From the company's board of directors to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, American culture seems to be promoting diversity and inclusiveness.
The large groups of young people are likely to be sensitive because they focus more on ethnic diversity than their older counterparts.
"This kind of thing is more difficult to get away from people than before," Zhu Katie, 25, said in an interview on Thursday, when a filter produced an insult to the user.
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer, decided to delete her account and encourage others to do the same.
In an essay and a telephone interview, she said she believed racial controversy reflected the lack of racial diversity in the recruitment process.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's employees for mostly white people, and the leadership was all male and at the end of the article added a label: # Delete.
As a Chinese American, Ms. Zhu said: "There are no different kinds of people in their employees, so it is possible to make such a decision, or there are some coloured people in their employees, but their positions will not allow them to speak freely."
Other observers shared her complaint that she had not received a response.
The company did not release data on employee diversity and said that it was a private company.
On Thursday, the company declined to discuss the ethnic background of its employees, but a spokesman said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on people with lower internal ratios and efforts to promote internal inclusion.
Ms. Zhu said she would close her account number: "I want to know if they need more users like us to oppose this behavior."
Congressional panel said military officials have distorted ISIS's intelligence
In a report released on Thursday, a congressional panel noted that officials from the United States Central Command changed the intelligence report, describing the war situation in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State more optimistic than the actual situation.
The interim report came from a dedicated working group set up by the House's military committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, which reported that the Central Command intelligence analysts had "widespread discontent," the analysts said that their superiors were tampering with their assessment of the war between the US and the Islamic State.
The Central Command (CENTCOM) in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a report on the report, "the information reviewed by the senior leaders of the central command has been more optimistic than the actual situation in the US counter-terrorism operation, and has always been more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies."
The Republican representative of California said: "The conduct of the central command is difficult to accept. One side is that our fighters are suffering from war, while the other side is the wrong analysis by senior policymakers."
The leadership of the central command has been extended to the highest level of the agency.
The report details the long-standing problems of the central command in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of the U.S. training of Iraqi forces.
While there is no conclusive evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration ordered the change of the reports, according to the report, the analysts felt that they were under pressure from the leaders of the central command to make a more optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).
"In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimony were much more optimistic than the actual situation," the report said.
For example, a Central Command official publicly said that it could take a major military operation in April or May 2015 to recapture Mosul.
Iraq's second largest city, Mosul, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, the results have been very clear," the Republican representative of Kansas, Michael pengpeo, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most senior intelligence officials from the United States Central Command controlled the command's intelligence products, concealing the threat from the Islamic State of Iraq.
Republicans have set up a special task force after they learned from analysts that intelligence about the Islamic State was manipulated.
As the investigation continues, there will be more discoveries following this report released on Thursday.
The attorney general of the Ministry of Defence also conducted a lengthy investigation of the Central Command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released its findings on Thursday, consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican special task force.
In a statement, the Democratic leader of the committee said that between 2014 and 2015, the central command developed an overly narrow process for the intelligence assessment of the Islamic State and Iraq's peacekeeping forces. "
Mr Shanda said the process "hampered the release of intelligence," lowered analysts' morale and "could not accept different opinions."
But Mr Xie and the Democrats also said they did not find any evidence to prove that the White House tried to put pressure on analysts at the Central Command, and that their conclusions were consistent with "preset or political narrative."
The wild animal daily reported preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Tuesday.
In August last year, the New York Times reported that after receiving a complaint from the Central Command analyst, the Pentagon attorney general began investigating.
Lieutenant General Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the congressional report before the attorney general's investigation was completed.
But he said: "Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense encourage a healthy dialogue on these important national security themes."
The impact of the investigation has exceeded the question of whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria has been achieved (a growing number of defense officials claim).
But last year, those claims led the public to question the extent to which President Obama could trust the military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas issued by the central command.
The criticism of the Islamic State intelligence is reminiscent of more than a decade ago, when the Central Command intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article, noting that George W. Bush's government, despite the opposition of many analysts, insisted on sending small troops to Iraq and little consideration of the 2003 invasion.
Mr Hooker played a key role in the campaign against the Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said Mr. Hu's team came to the conclusion that air strikes against the Islamic State refinery did not significantly reduce the economic revenue of terrorist organizations, because the terrorist group built a temporary refinery to continue selling oil on the black market, which is very different from the announcement made.
According to the magazine's September report, the Central Command did not publish the findings.
After several lawyers reviewed the Senate testimony about an overly optimistic assessment of the war, the commander of the Central Command, Lloyd Austin III, was criticized last year.
General Austin retired in April and is currently being replaced by Joseph Votel for his position at the central command.
The United States won four consecutive wins in the women's hockey tournament and will play a decisive role in the UK
Katie Baum, who won the game against Japan in 6 to 1, took the lead in the United States women's hockey team on Thursday, helping the United States to beat the Indian team by 3:0.
The five goals of the two games were stunning, but the 27-year-old, 27, said she did not know she had such a brilliant performance.
She said: "I don't know anything about it."
I'm not the kind of person who will remember that I have scored a few goals.
What she knows is that the United States team has won four wins in the Olympic Games and will compete with the team for the first time on Thursday with a 2-0 win over Japan.
Britain and the United States meet on a narrow road in the first round of the final game on Saturday.
Both teams are in the Champions League final, and the game will determine who will appear in the first team.
The team's first team will avoid the presence of a strong Dutch team, which will be able to go further.
In Saturday's game, the United States created a miracle with amazing performance, to know that at the London Olympics four years ago, the United States team was at the bottom of the 12 teams.
Barham was also in the team at the time.
Barham, who grew up in Brooklyn, Pennsylvania, picked up a hockey stick for the first time at the age of three, and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming the youngest member of the national team to date.
After failing to make the final list, she missed the 2008 Olympics.
In 2012, she and her teammates were not optimistic.
In the second year, British man Craig Parnham served as head coach and everything began to change.
"This is a cultural, psychological and substantive change," Baum said.
We did not reach the current level in London.
We had a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, he scored in the first half with a close backhand shot at the top.
India did not taste the winner in the current tournament, but the team showed amazing tenacity and kept the ratio of 1 to 0 at the end of the third quarter, when it broke out.
She took the ball along the left side of the court, then cut to the middle of the road, pumped into the net, and the United States 2-0 ahead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the fourth quarter.
The United States made its first zero opponent to the goalkeeper, who scored a goal in the first three games.
This time she has played an extraordinary role.
Barham, too.
"We are in good shape right now," he said. "But how good it will depend on the results of Saturday's game.
The bitter food during the Great Depression
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had just been elected president, sat in the presidential office for lunch.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt liked the food of the Fifth Avenue, such as goose liver sauce and Maryland steamed fish.
On that day, his menu was very simple: Tomato sauce devil eggs, mashed potatoes and dried fruit pudding.
"This is for food to be shared with the people who are suffering," said Jane Zimmerman.
Her husband, Andrew Cuomo, added: "It also reflects the way Americans eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Mr. Ko's last book, "stir-fry," is about American Chinese food, and Ms. qigman tells the life story of the slum tenants through food in her book "97 Orchard."
The new book, which they wrote together, will be published on Tuesday by Harper Press, which describes the food history of the United States during the Great Depression.
After demonstrating a shared vision of some food, they met a reporter at the sandwich shop in Eisenhower, a simple lunch counter in the iron area that has been open since the collapse of 1929.
Ms. Zigman, 54, ordered a cream cheese to break the olive sandwich, while Mr. Ko, 57, ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
The reporter ordered a baking roll, which the couple considered appropriate to discuss the diet during the Great Depression.
"The bread was very popular at the time," Ms. Grossman said.
There were peanut bread, liver bread and soy bread.
They are made with a raw material and a cheap water that can be poured on the raw material.
Imagine your dinner is peanuts.
Mr. Coe made a strange appearance.
"They're definitely like lead in your stomach," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the American Burton was a buffet, especially in the suburbs.
A group of female male farm workers cook dinner, breakfast, lunch and dinner have just come out of the pie.
In a war, the Americans gave food to hungry Europeans. "The Big Meal" recorded how the country suddenly ceased to be a rich place.
Mr. Ko explained why he and his wife wanted to write the book: "At the time, the food had become a major topic for Americans to feel uncomfortable."
Another unpleasant topic is the new food of the cold acid: Bread and stew, which is the main dish, and the stew is "the best way to cook food," Ms. Zimmerman said, because the chefs can use the butter to cover up the difficult ingredients.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dried fruit.
The meat that has been featured on the American table for years has turned into a rare luxury.
Strange hybrids only think about calories, compared to taste, or even basic culinary sense, and people first consider nutrition.
In the study of the book, including a variety of recipes, Ms. Zimmerman made a baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
"It's not common at the dinner table," Mr Coe said.
"It's too weird," Ms. Zimmerman said.
Peanut butter and roasted onion cannot match.
This is a feature of many family meals.
Family economists have an impact on the nation's eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, who served as the chef at the federal family's economic bureau from 1923 to 1943, which is historically unique.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to "fine-tune" and be brave enough to make bad foods such as pasta with carrots.
"The Big Meal" is a sumptuous "historical taste."
Especially worth playing is the government's response to the hungry people, such as the president's citizen Herbert Hoover, "someone else's business I can't manage" attitude.
Although he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse in his childhood, his diet was as exquisite as a millionaire.
Mr. Ko said: "He likes to eat European western food, such as fish with cucumber sauce."
He was dressed in a tuxedo and eating in a gilded dining room.
He was clearly separated from the people.
If his wife, Eleanor, encouraged him to set an example on his diet, President Roosevelt may have made the same mistake.
As the book says, the housekeeper hired by Ms. Roosevelt is not interested in the taste, so the "food in the White House is not only the most difficult food in Washington, but the worst food for cooking."
When the United States returned to the formal, many of the Great Depression cooking methods were abandoned.
Ms. Zigman said that what was left was our focus on calories and nutrition and the application of science to cooking.
The couple, who said they were writing the book, learned more about her mother's eating habits, such as how she did not throw away food.
"She is very afraid of wasting food," Mr Coe said.
"She actually made a lot of people sick," Ms. Ziman recalls.
For example, there was once a "cream bubble" incident.
After removing the plate, she and Mr. Ko took out a dessert they had prepared at home: This is the fruit pudding eaten by President Roosevelt during lunch.
"This is called cream fruit," she said, "and added that the name of a new fad for a common dish is" a common trick. "
There is no butter in this dessert, with only fruit, a bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
It was hard for everyone to put the spoon into the thick brown paste.
Unexpectedly, this dessert is good taste.
Mr. Ko also ate the second and the third spoon.
He thought it was an acceptable dessert, and told his wife, "it would be better to add some chopped walnuts."
Unfortunately, the latest monthly report showed that crude oil production continued to increase in July, with Saudi production reaching a record high.
The report raises doubts about the credibility of Opec, and the road to the recovery of oil prices is still strewn with thorns.
On Monday, the chairman of OPEC and Qatar Energy Secretary Sada said OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28.
The monthly report released on Wednesday showed that the entire organization, including Gabon, rose 46,000 barrels per day in July to 33.11 million barrels per day.
OPEC also said in the monthly report that the low price of crude oil has prompted global refiners to produce more refined oils, adding to the extent of oversupply in the market.
According to the news, and the expectation of higher crude oil production in the United States and an unexpected increase in crude oil inventories, international oil prices closed for two consecutive days.
As of Wednesday, the price of light crude futures, which was delivered in September by the New York Mercantile Exchange, fell 2.48%, while the London Brent crude futures price fell 2.07% in October.
According to Reuters, the proposed meeting of the oil-producing countries is unlikely to tighten the supply, and the data released by the U.S. Energy Information Agency also depress the market.
On Wednesday, Iran's official news agency quoted Iran's oil minister as saying that Iran's daily crude oil production was at 3.85 million barrels a day, the highest level since 2008.
News of the meeting has just emerged, and Gazprom, Russia's energy minister, said there was no need for a new round of frozen production under the current oil price.
The last OPEC meeting was held in April, and OPEC members failed to reach an agreement on any measure.
Emma Richards, an analyst at bmiresearch oil and gas, said the market and the media could overreact to the OPEC meeting.
Helima, head of commodity strategy at the Royal Bank of Canada, said it would change the mood of the market by releasing them to signal the deal.
The device is like a smoke and a mirror that leads to people's eyes (deliberately misleading).
Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at the German commercial bank, said that the likelihood of OPEC trying to stabilize the market through the September meeting was very low.
This is likely to further undermine confidence in the market, after all, this organization has played a "wolf."
Throughout the country, the illegal distribution of medical advertisements, complaints and reporting centres, as well as medical institutions that have been punished repeatedly, will focus on the spot.
The National Health Insurance Commission and the national Chinese medicine administration will arrange to conduct inspections of the special supervision and inspection work of some provinces.
According to the media, due to the massive influx of capital into Internet Medicine, the problem of the current product homogenization is serious, the investment boom has receded and the capital enters the waiting period.
According to data from the research center for the management of AI in Hong Kong, internet medical companies have died in the first year of entrepreneurship, and about 20% of the initial Internet healthcare companies have ceased to exist.
However, in most of the Internet healthcare companies struggling to finance a round A or B round, there are several sub-sectors leading companies that still have access to capital craze.
It seems that the internet medical startup can not be "a bee," but to see the market demand, sinking the heart to do special, deep.
The fish jumped from $120.3 million, accounting for 40% of the registered capital, and 90% of Kyushu equipment companies, accounting for 60% of the registered capital.
In recent years, with the state's policy support in medical informatization, electronic and integrated supply chain management system has gradually entered all levels of hospitals.
The company's cooperation with Kyushu is aiming at the demand of the market, helping the hospital to build the advanced supply chain management system and use it as an opportunity to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many Internet healthcare companies, I was initially focused on the vertical Field of the Internet obstetrics, with deep tillage and doctors on both sides.
The pregnant mother is not only able to consult a doctor for free 24 hours and a one-on-one, but can also pay for medical treatment.
At the doctor's end, I broke the geographical limit by taking organizational experts to give grassroots doctors online lectures, peer exchanges, case discussions, etc.
At present, doctors have opened three plates and continue to educate doctors, doctors and doctors for help.
The provision includes online learning, case discussions, academic exchanges; social platforms with hospitals, medical doctors, and legal aid, entrepreneurial support and other services needed for medical treatment or personal life.
According to media reports, ce Wang Lei recently said that Ali Health "is willing to sink" to win big health data.
Internet companies and data companies lack professionalism, and the method of writing in the same article is not uniform.
Ali's current layout in the field of health care is divided into three pieces, namely, Ali Health, cat medical museum and the payment of the future hospital.
Wang Lei admits that medical and health entrepreneurship will be more difficult than other industries, "This is not only a matter of how much money, but also sink the heart, endure the loneliness and slowly."
Staying up late to watch the Olympic Games can damage the heart
Brazil's Olympic Games are in full swing, even if the event is broadcast in the country at midnight, many citizens will stay up late to watch.
In this regard, the doctor specifically reminded that staying up late to watch the event is a health hazard, which could trigger cardiovascular disease.
If you stay up late for a long time, the hormone still produces a lot of secretion, the body will continue to be in a state of intense excitement, unable to get a normal recovery, which can cause blood vessels to contract and increase blood pressure, causing cardiovascular disease.
Han Zhiyuan especially reminded that people with high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood lipids, smoking habits, family history and other cardiovascular risk factors, if staying up late, would be more prone to cardiovascular disease.
If staying up late, not only the cardiovascular function is affected, but the gastrointestinal function, the immune system, the neuroendocrine system will be affected, and even the risk of cancer will increase.
For old friends, Han Zhiyuan advised not to stay up late to watch the Olympic Games, especially in the history of cardiovascular disease.
During the last "World Cup" football game, Han Zhiyuan received a patient who was more than 60 years old, and his myocardial infarction triggered or was related to staying up late.
Han Zhiyuan said that since the beginning of this year, his department has received some 25 years of myocardial infarction or stroke patients, which is largely due to the lifestyle of patients who stay up late.
Do not stay up late every day, staying up late to watch the favorite sports, other projects may wait for the next day to watch the event replay.
Stay up late in time to replenish water, eat more fruit, can prevent blood vessel blockage, enhance body immunity.

The documentary "polar" is a large work focusing on the third polar Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, with a new perspective on the story of Tibetan tradition and modernity and the interaction between Tibet and the world.
The biggest advantage of VR works is to give the audience a unique view of "immersion," which also raises higher requirements for the filming process.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union sent missiles into Cuba, which nearly led to a nuclear war in the United States.
The incident was seen as the pinnacle of the cold war, known as the "Cuban missile crisis."
But it is little known that during the Cold War, a strong solar storm also narrowly led the United States to launch a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, which was first published by researchers only on August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm caused severe disruption to the U.S. military's radar and radio communications in the Arctic.
These radars are part of the U.S. ballistic missile early warning system to monitor Soviet missiles.
The paper, completed by researchers at the University of Colorado in the United States, interviewed the US military personnel who were involved in the prediction and analysis of the sun, and looked at the non-confidential literature.
According to the paper, in the 1960s, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from launching a nuclear war, the United States Air Force had always had a plane carrying nuclear warheads flying in the sky.
U.S. military commanders did not know that the culprit was the solar storm, not the Soviet Union, and ordered the fighters to enter the combat readiness.
Fortunately, the US military's solar activity, which began in the late 1950s, and its research on Earth's electromagnetic interference, ultimately blocked the potential military conflict.
Later, he sent a detailed report on the information provided by the United States Air Force.
The immediate consequence of the solar storm is that the US military has since viewed space weather as a combat concern and has built a stronger space weather forecasting system.
Members of the public, in their daily travel, found that the love car was blocked by strange vehicles, and could be used to solve this problem by using the "micro-mail" function.

Following the launch of the service, in daily life, members of the public can solve such problems by using the "micro-mail" function to block their vehicle when the driver is not in the scene.
This new service function is quick to save administrative costs; the second is to respect and protect the personal privacy of citizens; three is all-weather and all-time service.
As long as the public has a small letter, it can operate in a very convenient manner, which can make it easier for both sides to "meet" to alleviate the problem of parking, and reduce the number of security cases involving cars.
On the other hand, the traffic control department of Xi'an said that the traffic police will take different disposal measures according to the actual situation, depending on the situation.

On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly issued a new edition of the US-Japan defense cooperation pointer in New York, allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role globally.
It was the same day that U.S. Defense Secretary Carter, US Secretary of State John Kerry, the foreign minister of Japan, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the Japanese defense minister, Central Valley, attended a press conference in New York.
This is the fifth time the Chinese folk think tank issued Japan's military assessment report, and also the fourth edition of the English version.
The report is divided into nine chapters, including overall policy adjustment, military strength, defence budget, military deployment, weapons equipment, institutional development reform, military training, foreign military security cooperation, military security relations with China, and other content.
According to the report, 2015 is the year that Abe's government has promoted major policy adjustments in the security sector for several years.
Since then, Japan's initiatives in the field of security will focus mainly on the operational aspects of the rule of law, strategic implementation and policy implementation, rather than the substantial adjustments and changes in the framework, mechanisms and policies.
The report stresses that Abe's cabinet is trying to break through the above three points to promote Japan's "normal nationalization" and the self-defense forces to go out to intervene in international security affairs, strengthen Japan's alliance and prevent China's multiple purposes.
Previously, the China Strategic Culture Association issued a report on the military assessment of Japan on June 5 2012, July 19 2013, July 23 2014, and June 30 2015.

The residence is gray, along with the perimeter defense fence, the second floor wall, the barbed wire fence and the vehicle barrier layer.
Complementary public sports facilities short boards
The black coal depot is turned into a football field of "green grass"; the top of the red brick factory is turned into a modern sports pavilion.
On the National Fitness Day, the South sunset horse sports culture park, outside the city of Hangzhou, unveiled the mysterious veil.
There was a coal field, which had been idle for more than a decade, leaving a large number of illegal buildings and garbage.
After the renovation, it has become a sports culture park and will officially open to the public in November, providing free sports venues to the public, and there is no doubt that it has opened up a whole new fertile ground for the sport.
This reminds people of Hangzhou Chen's body school, the Chinese swimming altar "Huangpu Military Academy" to swim out multiple world championships.
The fame of the pool has been produced continuously, with a vivid interpretation of the rich mass base of competitive sports and national sports to provide good conditions for the selection of professional players.
The level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of the national sport, and competitive sports depend on the national sport in a certain sense, and the national sport depends on the conditions of the venue.
It is reported that, as of 2015, China's per capita sports area is 150 times larger than that of the new China, but still lags far behind the sports power.
In June this year, the State Council issued the national fitness plan (2016-2020), which will focus on the development of mass sports.
In order to complement this short board, on the one hand, the relevant departments should take full account of the layout of the stadium in urban planning.
On the other hand, the established public sports venues, including stadiums in units such as schools, should maximize the scope of openness and improve efficiency as far as possible.
The Rio Olympics, which is now in full swing, inspires people's enthusiasm for sports and awakens everyone's participation.
Geely obtained a lawyer's fee in the battle with Merck's patent for hepatitis C
According to the judgment of the United States district judge, Gilder science has the right to a lawyer's fee generated in a patent lawsuit against hepatitis C, a pharmaceutical company.
In June, after the United States judge found that Merck was in breach of the law, including perjury and other immoral acts, he was exempted from the payment of $200 million in compensation in the amount of $200 million resulting from the sale of two patents by Geely's best-selling drug, Sofia and harvani.
In a lawsuit on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Lambert Freeman said that he did not have to bear the costs incurred by the defense.
Merck is trying to chase Gilder, a new generation of hepatitis C drug market, which can cure more than 90% of hepatitis patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Geely and Merck sued each other and both sides claimed that they were the owners of the laboratory work of an effective ingredient in Geely.
The United States backed forces announced that they had taken the country back from the Islamic State.
A spokesman for the force said on Friday that the remaining Islamic State soldiers in the city had all left, and the United States backed forces had completely controlled the northern city of Manchester, near the Turkish border.
Following the departure of militants inside the city, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now sweeping the city.

He told Reuters: "Manchester is under our control all over the season, but we are still sweeping."
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paying 34.2% of federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released its 2105 tax return on Friday, declaring the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband's income of $10.75 million in 2015 and a 34.2% federal tax.
In 2015, the Clinton couple's charitable contributions amounted to $1 million, most of which contributed to the Clinton Foundation; the speech fee of former President Bill Clinton reached nearly $5.3 million, while the former secretary of state, with a book on her tenure in the State Council, received $3 million in income from the publisher, Simon and Shuster.
Clinton's campaign partner, Senator Tim Cain of the federal state of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holden, released 10 years of tax returns.
Two people have paid 20.3% of federal taxes in 2015.
Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane will continue to be a benchmark for financial transparency, "Clinton's campaign aide, Jennifer Palmieri, said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump has covered up with false reasons and retracted his promise to publish his tax returns.
Although the law does not require, in accordance with established practice, US presidential candidates should disclose their tax returns.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyer cited the IRS audit as a reason to refuse to publish his tax returns.
Clinton campaign aide Ian Sutherland said on Twitter that you were the Lord and attached to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release his tax returns before the audit was completed.
Critics of Trump, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, said Trump's refusal to publish the tax returns would raise questions about its capital net worth, charitable donations, business transactions and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton pounced on the issue and released a Web video on Friday, highlighting high-profile Democrats urging Trump to publish his tax.
On Thursday, she raised the issue in an economic policy speech in Michigan.
She told the crowd: "For decades, he has refused to publish his tax returns like other presidential candidates."
According to CNN, Trump did not pay a penny in two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, saying that the current situation could remain.
Federal tax has become a big issue in the presidential campaign.
Clinton, with a billionaire investor Warren Buffett, has named a rule to ensure that people earning more than $1 million a year pay at least 30% of their taxes.
President Obama also backed the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he is also receiving an audit of IRS, which Trump is "afraid" is not tax authorities, but voters.
The earliest tax returns released by the Clinton campaign group were in 2007.
The average federal tax rate paid by Mrs. Clinton, who currently lives in New York, between 2007 and 2014, reached about 32%, with a combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons' tax returns for 2015 show that, unlike most Americans, they earn only $100.
Their main investment is the low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clinton couple's dividend and interest income is $109,000.

Jewish film producer criticized the Berlin hotel for deleting Israeli phone code Reuters News in accordance with Arab customers' request
A French film producer with Jewish ancestry told the media that the karbinski hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's phone code, and the hotel staff said it was "demanding" by Arab customers, which sparked an uproar.
Claude langzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Holocaust," expressed his disappointment at the karbinsky hotel and published an open letter in Frankfurt, Germany.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann wanted to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
But Israel is not listed in countries where guests can speak directly from the room.
Israel actually disappeared in Germany's first Dublin in 2016?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, guests can call the Israeli phone through the call center of the karbinski hotel.
To seek an explanation, the filmmaker asked the front desk of the hotel.
Langzmann said in the letter that he was "shocked" by the response he received from the front desk.
The hotel staff said it was "a deliberate decision by the kbinski hotel management."
The reason for doing so is outraged by the filmmaker.
Langzmann quoted the employee as saying that most of our guests were Arabs and they asked to delete Israel's code. "
According to the report of the South German daily, the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jarkov Handsman, described the matter as "a disgrace."
We were surprised to learn of the incident.
The story itself is a huge shame.
What happened in Germany and the hotel chain is a disgrace.
There is no explanation for this matter.
"We hope the hotel will draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident sparked a heated debate online, and everyone thought it was a scandal.
The cabinski hotel was believed to be "humble" in order to meet the demands of Arab customers.
Another post pointed directly to the hotel "really not to face," and pointed out that the main street in the famous kudham Street is located near a synagogue.
According to the weekly magazine, the hotel quickly clarified all the charges, claiming that everything was "negligent" and "apologized" to langtzmann.
The South German daily quoted kebinski as saying: "There has never been a direct order to remove Israel from the quick dial list."
The newspaper also said that Israel's code has been added to the list.
Brazilian students who used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters
On Thursday, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, students clashed with police during a protest against the reform of the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the protesters.
The cause of the incident was that law enforcement officials tried to disperse the students, so the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the parade, expressing their dissatisfaction with the schemes.
To save money, the Governor of St. Paul plans to close 100 public schools and 300,000 students will go to school.
Some of the students who took part in the protest expressed their dissatisfaction with the interim president, Michelle Meyer, through graffiti on the wall.
Just a few days before the latest protests, protesters took to the streets to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the state Senate.
Scottish cyclist Karl Skinner won a reputation after winning a gold medal
The Scottish cyclist, Karl Skinner, helped the British trio to successfully defend the Olympic gold medal following the 2012 London Games last night at the men's group race in Rio cycling.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist, who replaced his Scottish compatriot, Sir Chris Hoi, became the backbone of the team, and even the legendary cyclist was proud of him when the young Skinner beat the popular New Zealand team and won his reputation.
Four years ago, the British team was amazing, and Roy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
The British team was ranked sixth in the world cycling championships in London in March, and Howard retired from it. Then, the British team made a brilliant comeback.
During the Beijing Olympic Games to the London Olympic Games, the British team's problem was to replace the "first circle of experts" Jamie Staff.
It was in Hades that the convoy did so.
Howard's retirement also left a blank, and Chien Edie and Matt Clancy wanted to fill the void.
After seeing the potential of Skinner, the British team of men's coaches insisted that he should be elected to the national team, and Skinner was not expected.
Skinner's partner, who won the gold medal with Howard four years ago, has set a record for the Olympic games in qualifying, but the result was overtaken by the New Zealand team in the first round.
The three British cycling finally beat their rivals and won the gold medal.
While Sinclair was slightly behind, Kenny took the lead for the team and Skinner kept the lead until the end.
The change of strategy is the key to this reversal, and Snyder has opted for a larger flywheel, so the pace is slower, which allows Kenny, especially Skinner, to keep pace.
Roy watched the game as a BBC commentator, and Skinner, Kenny and Sinclair saw him when he boarded the podium.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist, Skinner, said: "It was a surprise to me."
I'm just doing everything I can to make myself famous.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champion.
This is incredible.
There is nothing better than this victory.
After winning the gold medal with Kenny and Roy at the 2012 London Olympics, Higgins admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a poor start.
Later, he withdrew the comment and England's rivals were unable to appeal.
And this victory has no such problems.
"It's like in London, it is the British flag on the platform," he said.
We just got the team three months ago.
We have lost a lot of world champions, so it is amazing to be able to defend the Olympic title.
This is just a game and a gold medal for the seven of the 10 Olympic gold medals at the Beijing and London Games.
If this symbolizes the progress we have made over the past five months, then we will continue to succeed in the cycling Pavilion over the next five days.
According to Kenny, he is not unlikely to replicate his feat of winning three gold medals at a single Olympic Games.
If that is the case, he is 12 years younger than Howard, and also on March 23 (this day seems to be the sacred day of the British stadium, the born Kenny, who was born on this day, will have six gold medals and one silver.
This achievement is flat with Roy.
Kenny will then fight for the three-day race to begin today.
The 28-year-old Bolton said: "I will focus on this game for the time being.
The team is always the best.
You can win the game with his teammates.
Frankly speaking, a person can win a bit lonely.
"If he can win another two gold medals, he should have been awarded a knighthood," he said.
It was the only match of the day to produce a medal, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Brad Willis, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen duel pursued the race for the top four - kilometer group.
Their results were 351.43.
The world record for the winner of the 2012 Olympic gold medal in London was 351659.
The first round and the final (at 10:42 PM) will be held today on the second day of the game, and Venus will undoubtedly be the focus of all the attention.
He had a dispute with the officials before the qualifying match yesterday, when officials asked him to measure height.
In the women's team, which is due to come to an end tomorrow, Laura Troy, Joanna Rousseff, Eleanor buck, and Kate Archibald, from Middlesbrough, were promoted to a new world record of 413.260.
The British team relied on a strong field cycling team to take the initiative in the middle of the Olympic Games and won multiple medals.
After demonstrating its absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Games, the British cycling team was slightly disappointed during the trip to Rio.
Many setbacks occurred during the period, including the resignation of the April technical director, Sean Sutton, who resigned as a result of the allegations of gender discrimination and bullying, as well as the retirement of the legendary figures of Khoi and Victoria Pendleton.
But the first night of the bicycle pavilion is enough to prove that the England team will play a key moment to reach the peak of the legend.

The head of the Industrial Coordination Division of the National Development and Reform Commission said today that the excess steel capacity is a global problem.
China's capacity utilization rate in recent years is higher than the global average, which is higher than that of countries and regions such as the US and Europe.
Our country has taken resolute and effective measures to eliminate excess capacity, and it is gradually becoming apparent.
The head pointed out that on the global issue of excess steel capacity, the Central Committee of the CPC Central Committee attached great importance to it.
Departments and regions actively carry out the implementation of the deployment of the State Council and seriously carry out their work. This year, the pressure to reduce crude steel production capacity will be around 45 million tons.
According to China's national conditions, China does not encourage the export of steel, but rather a series of practical measures to control the export of steel.
The person in charge stressed that the international trade in steel products is essentially market behavior, which stems from the needs of importing countries, consumers' comprehensive consideration of product price ratio and other factors.
The implementation of trade protection measures does not help fundamentally solve the development of the global steel industry; on the contrary, it will only cause further impact on the international trade order.
When it comes to debt, the head stressed that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly addressed in the process of eliminating excess capacity.
Because of the large scale and scope of the assets of steel enterprises, the debt relationship of some enterprises is complex, and if the disposal is inappropriate, it is possible to trigger regional risks.
According to the head of the person, in recent years, with the downward pressure on the economy, the overall demand for society has gradually weakened, and the utilization rate of some industries has decreased, and the enterprise production and operation difficulties have increased.
Some enterprises do not adapt to the changes in the market environment, the production business is unsustainable and even on the verge of collapse, but it is constrained by some institutional mechanisms, which have become a "zombie enterprise" with more barriers to exit.
The existence of such enterprises distorts the market signal, reduces the efficiency of factor resource utilization, increases the cost of social management, which hinders the establishment of fair competition market environment.
The main reason for the loss is the weak market demand and low capacity utilization of the global steel industry.
Our country mainly adopts the market mechanism, economic means and the rule of law, the government is mainly to do the job market and social stability to ensure fair and fair market order.
The head stressed that the next step would be to unswervingly continue to work on productive capacity to ensure the completion of five years of the target of 100 million to 150 million tons of crude steel production capacity.

For example, Fujian proposes to publish, at least every three years, the scope of public services and facilities enjoyed by the holder of a residence permit.
According to the Provisional Regulations of the residence permit, the public security organ shall produce a residence permit within 15th days from the date of the admissibility.
For the time limit for issuance, most regions are in line with the national version, which is distributed within 15th days.
The Hebei provincial police station shall issue residence permits within 3 working days from the date of admissibility.
Jiangxi stipulates that the public security organ shall make a residence permit within 5 working days from the date of admissibility.
According to the Provisional Regulations on residence permit, the above-mentioned areas are clear, for the first time, to apply for a residence permit, which is exempt from the original fee.
In the case of Sichuan, the local public security police stations or the entrusted community service agencies should strictly enforce the approved fee and fee standards, and strictly prohibit the super-scope, the standard fee or the cost of the ride.
On July 27, 2016, the Communist Party secretary of the former Ganzhou City, Chen Yang Xia, went to the provincial capital to report to work, serving as the head of the party's windstorm supervision room (Deputy Director grade, probationary period of one year).
The red wine, which was consumed that night, was provided by UNIFIL, and other costs were borne by one of Liu.
Jiangxi province reported that Chen Yang Xia, Cheng Liang and other people, organized and accepted by the private Association, violated the spirit of the central eight rules and violated the party's discipline.
Bogba has eaten two yellow cards in the Italian Cup last season, according to the rules, which will be automatically suspended.
Although he has returned to the Premier League, the FA will still defer its cumulative ban to the Premier League.
As a result, his return to Manchester United's first show will be extended to the home game against Southampton on August 14 in a match against Bournemouth.
As the first round of 12 new show in 2014, Sarkozy will officially land in the NBA next season and join Philadelphia 76.
Sarkozy is a young European player, and many fans are not well aware of him, but through this Olympic Games, he believes that Sarkozy's performance has left a deep impression on people.
The last time Croatia narrowly won the Spanish game, Sarkozy successfully sealed off Paul Gasol at the last minute to try to drag the game into overtime.
Recently, 76 team manager Brett Brown gave Sarkozy a high degree of evaluation, and the Spurs boss thought he saw the shadow of the young Manu - giobili in Surrey.
It is clear that Mr Sarkozy has shown his talent and has made 76 people look forward to him.
In the first two games of the games in Croatia, Sarkozy scored 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.
In the first half, Sarkozy showed his ability to pull out of space on the pitch and, after breaking through with his teammates, he was able to shoot in the third line.
Although the 76 person's internal line is currently hoarding a number of talented young players, they do not have Sarkozy's ability to do so.
From the cap to the launch of the long pass and complete the assists, the inner line players who are able to do this in the NBA are numbered.
Since the start of the games, Sarkozy has scored 13 points, eight rebounds and five assists in three games.
Since the decision to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014, James has signed two contracts for 1+1.
As the NBA's current labor agreement is about to enter the final year, as the vice president of the NBA players' union, James will be in the forefront of the labor agreement negotiations.
Given the surge in revenue from the Union, thanks to the new TV broadcast deal, as well as the fight between the old board and the players about how to deal with the money, there is fear that the NBA will be stalled next summer.
But for James, he doesn't have to worry about being a free agent next summer because he has signed a three-year contract with the Cavaliers.
Whenever the 2017-18 season officially begins, James is in the contract.
Since the launch of the iPhone SE, the mobile market has also ushered in a small screen machine boom.
Not long ago, Nubia also launched its Z11 series of debut works: Nubia z11mini.
Nubia z11mini continues its consistently excellent photo gene, and is equipped with a single hand more easily held 5.0 inch screen, easy to use and easy to use fingerprint identification, and has achieved its audience's experience.
Nubia's newly listed small screen photo cell phone z11mini reduced the price of 200 yuan, from the original 1499 yuan to 1299 yuan.
On the exterior side, Nubia z11mini uses a 5-inch 1080p screen, which is still a classic "little red circle" design.
The box is a metal material, with a symmetrical design and configuration of the Type-C data interface.
The future of Portland smelter is fraught with uncertainty due to the cancellation of power supply contracts
The power company, which supplied power to the plant, revealed that a factory owner would terminate a supply contract, resulting in the failure of all supply contracts, located in the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria and hundreds of workers at the plant are currently facing an uncertain future.
The move took place after the Victorian government decided not to continue the subsidies to ensure the operation of the plant.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will expire in November.
2,000 workers from Alcoa's Portland plant may face unemployment.
As soon as the plant closes, there may be as many as 2,000 people directly or indirectly unemployed.
And because the plant's electricity consumption accounts for about 10% of Victoria's total power output, it is likely to have a knock-on effect.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Hanry corner smelter, which led to the closure of the angersi Island power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is currently losing money and is at risk of closure.
The move was made after forecasts of the plant's future years, initially due to the strength of the Australian dollar, and most recently because of the price of the plant.
The company was able to provide electricity to the large aluminium smelter through the old Eyang power plant in the Delaware Valley, which predicts that three other factory owners will also terminate their agreement.
The largest shareholder in the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, while China's Citic Group and Japan's pill red Co. also hold a small stake.
The joint venture said: "It is expected that the Portland plant will continue to operate, which means the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand."
The company said the contracts were "hedging contracts" that should have been in force since November 2016.
The termination of the contract is 12 months, so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, it is predicted that the contracts will continue to generate revenue in the fiscal year 2017," the power company said.
Any revenue impact that may have arisen from the 2018 fiscal year is now subject to an optimistic outlook for wholesale electricity prices in the futures market.
The company said that it had reduced the contract value of $187 million in the "termination activity."
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "would not affect the Company's ability to operate the smelter or guarantee the power supply of the smelter.
The US company said it had signed a 20-year contract with laeyang in 2010, which would have entered into force in November, but the company did not explain why it was withdrawn.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago factory in the vicinity of Newcastle are closed because of the poor economic situation in the industry.
According to comments made earlier this week by analysts, the head of operations, Stephen Michelson, said Portland's electricity consumption reached about 600 megawatts per year, and the Tomago factory reached about 900 megawatts.
If the two factories are closed, the demand for electricity market will be greatly reduced.
"As a power company, which is not good news for us," he said.
Community legal centres shut up 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups have been shut out of the Community's legal center every year, and the funding of the service has been stretched, and now faces further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three of every five people are denied access to free legal advice and agency services, most of whom are elderly, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, and those who do not have the resources to fight unfair evictions.
The lack of funding for community legal services has long exceeded the limits and now faces further funding cuts.
From June next year, the federal government's funding for these legal centres will be reduced by 30%.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland community legal center, said that according to the latest report by the law center of the National Community Association, thousands of people were turned away each year.
Mr Farrell said that if the federal government did not change the existing decision, the situation will only get worse.
He said: "The community legal centre in Queensland is chronically underfunded, meaning that thousands of people will not be able to get the important services they need."
Those who need to stay away from the violence, the people who are unable to repay the huge debts, face the breakdown of the family, the squeezed workers, all face legal problems, and the report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% from June 2017, meaning that thousands of vulnerable groups in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Queensland senator George Brady to immediately withdraw the decision to cut the money so that people can get the help they need in the face of legal problems.
Last year, the state government promised to raise legal aid funds to the national average.
It is now time to focus on community legal centres and their needs for communities, and the government must also invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team was charged with pulling a gun
New York: Trump's campaign team was charged after pulling the gun to a staff member after driving a Jeep in February for his Northern California head.
Vincent Bondini, a former software trainer for the state's campaign team, described the incident on Wednesday in a state court in Charlotte.
Mr Bondini said he hoped the matter would be resolved internally, but after months of waiting he realized that "it can't happen."
According to Bodini, the head of the man, Earl Philip, "pulled out a pistol, put his right index finger on the board and put the gun on the knee of Vincent."
After complaining about the leadership of the local and regional campaign teams, Bodini learned from the file that at least four people had experienced the same thing.
Bodini said in the complaint: "No shooting does not cause harm."
Just two days before the case, the Republican presidential candidate told the crowd in North Carolina that if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and picked her favorite judge, "the person who supports the Second Amendment," as well as gun supporters and gun lovers may take action, has sparked outrage.
Trump's campaign team said the media had broken his word, and he did not advocate violence.
In his complaint, Bodini asked the campaign team to compensate for his lack of supervision, but also asked Philip to compensate for his attacks, beatings and mental injuries.
Trump spokesman Howard Hicks did not immediately respond to the news.
It's impossible to connect to Philip.
According to WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotte, Philip left the campaign team in the near future.
His consulting firm, consulting services, did not immediately respond to the call.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign team has been plagued with controversy.
The case is for Bondini and President Trump's presidential campaign, 16-cs-14300, and the General Court of the High Court of Mecklenburg County (Charlotte).
Britain must pass the Olympic spirit and expansion of Heathrow airport
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our communities, London and the country as a whole.
For me, this is the charm of Heathrow, just as at the 2012 London Olympics, we made every effort to ensure that our country and region can benefit from these events.
The Olympics benefited from Stratford and the East.
And we will again benefit the region by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
As far as our local community is concerned, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeship jobs, 40,000 new jobs and get young people around the airport out of unemployment.
Just before the 2012 London Games, some people thought that Heathrow's expansion project was too big.
I was told that the UK will not be ready for the Olympics and we will lose face in front of the world.
The skeptics were wrong about the 2012 Olympics, and their suspicions about the Heathrow project will prove to be wrong.
While there will always be hurdles to overcome, Heathrow is solving every problem that faces.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is the infrastructure project for most people, not just a few.
The expansion project will create as many as 180,000 new jobs, 21 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a technology and employment wealth around the airport and across the UK.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team, which has been on time and has completed 110 billion pounds of infrastructure investment projects within the budget, including the T5 terminal in the world's best airport terminal for five consecutive years and the T2 terminal between the world's busiest two runways.
Now, they are preparing to build a third runway with €16 billion in private investment.
The UK has successfully hosted the 2012 London Olympics, and I believe that the Heathrow airport expansion project will also be a huge success.
It is a good time for us to pass the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow airport, so that we can escort our future and create a technology and employment wealth that is proud of the UK.
Lord Paul Davies is the chairman of Heathrow airport board and former UK Treasury business counsellor
A woman committed suicide on the Swiss motorway and was killed
The victim was lying on the motorway at midnight.
The woman who attempted suicide was run over by several vehicles on the highway on Thursday morning, and police are looking for witnesses.
The accident happened on the A1 motorway near the state of Moore on Thursday morning.
The state police said a woman was "desperate" lying on the road at night and was run over by multiple vehicles.
The victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, apparently had a suicidal intent. She was run over by multiple vehicles, including a truck.
The woman died instantly.
Police have revealed that several drivers have been investigated, but some of the drivers have yet to confirm. The police are now calling for them as well as the accident witnesses to come to the investigation.
His lawyer told the Geneva Tribune that a criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a regular process of such incidents.
But it is not yet known whether the driver will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
"This will be determined by the prosecutor," said hoftel.
According to the results of two other similar cases in the past five years, drivers will not be held accountable.
According to the report, both cases were caused by people walking into the highway late at night, and the final verdict was that the driver could not expect pedestrians to cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was alleged to have died as a result of negligence, and the allegation was that in August 2014, she had struck a man on the A1 motorway near Palau and killed her.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim walked across the road after drinking.
The judge said after the investigation that the policewoman was completely legal at the time, and the man appeared on the road "completely unexpected and unpredictable," and that the policewoman made an emergency call after the incident.
Anyone who can provide information about the accident near morale on Thursday should dial 021 644 846 or 021 644 44 to contact the police.
NASA climate model: Venus once fit for human habitation
According to the predictions of NASA's new climate model, Venus has been fit for human habitation.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Institute have developed a model to explore the past of Venus, and the tools and algorithms used by the model are very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether Venus, which has a surface temperature, water, and atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, has an environment similar to that of the Earth.
Previously, scientists believed that Venus's spin was slower because of its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulations suggest that Venus may have had a thin, similar atmosphere similar to the Earth's atmosphere, and the speed of rotation was also slower.
The model can also show the early terrain of Venus.
The dry areas of Venus may be larger than Earth, but there have been enough water and geographical changes to nurture life and prevent rapid evaporation.
In the early days, the brightness of sunlight on Venus was 30% higher than that of the Earth.
"In the model simulation of the gordade Space Institute, the slow rotation of Venus has allowed its side to spend nearly two months in the daytime," said Anthony deljanio, a scientist at the Goddard Space Institute.
This warms the surface and produces rain that can form thick clouds, and thick clouds are like an umbrella to block most of the sun's heat.
The simulated result is that the average climate temperature of Venus is actually a few degrees lower than the current Earth.
The model simulation of Venus evolution is similar to that of previous planetary scientists.
Although there may have been life on Venus, Venus is exposed to high temperatures and ultraviolet light in the billions of years.
The ocean evaporates on the planet, and water vapor is also burned by ultraviolet light.
With the escape of hydrogen, there is only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse gas effect, creating the Venus we know today.
The researchers published the results of the new Venus climate model in the Journal of Geophysical Research.
Patrick Roy resigned as coach of the avalanche
Patrick Roy, who resigned on Thursday as manager and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche ice hockey team, said he had no say at the decision-making level.
Joe Sutherland, managing director of Colorado's executive vice president, confirmed the news and said the club would immediately start looking for a new head coach.
In a statement, Mr. Roy, 50, said in a statement: "In the past three years, I have lived with vigour, passion and determination to carry out the duties of the head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche."
I seriously thought about how to improve the team throughout the summer, so that it would have the power to step up the ladder.
For this reason, the goal of the manager and vice president must be consistent with the goals of the club.
He also needs to have a voice in decisions that affect the team's performance.
At present, however, these conditions have not been met.
Gonzalez hired Roy on May 23, 2013, and he thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Mr Sarkozy said: "Patrick told me about his decision today."
We thank him for his contribution to the club and hope that he will be sailing in the future.
Roy was nominated as the best coach of the Jack Adams Award in the first season of the ruling avalanche in 1865.
He helped the club get 112 points, the first in the middle part, but the Colorado team was eliminated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and lost in the last two years.
In the course of the season, the Avalanche scored 39 to 39, and ended up losing the second card qualification for the western Grand League in five points.
As a keeper of the Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley Cups and won two seats for the Montreal Canadian team and the avalanche.
Workers in the North Sea oilfield stop strike and continue talks
The chief negotiator said workers in the North Sea oil field stopped a strike on pay and the parties to the dispute began a new round of talks.
On the North Sea oil platform operated by Royal Dutch Shell, there have been a number of strikes against the Wood Group, the oil field service company.
According to a joint statement, "Wood Group and unite and trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the current dispute settlement process."
We will begin early next week and hold a number of all-day meetings in the coming weeks to revisit these issues.
The union said its recent action was to protest the highest possible wage reduction of 30 percent, which was the first time the union has taken this action for the first time in 25 years.
Wood Group's compensation for the North Sea contractors fell by about 9% this year due to market pressure.
Before the cuts, the company reduced the remuneration of maritime contractors by 10% in 2014.
The company said it would help the company survive the slump in the market again.
Shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to close 10 countries' oil and gas equipment, because the company needs to streamline its operations after the merger with the British energy company BP.
Energy companies are under pressure from falling crude oil prices and the Brexit decision in June.
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labor dispute in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea is vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that serves most people, not just a few," Dave said in the statement.
In 2016, spending on new North Sea projects is not expected to exceed US$ 1.4 billion, while the average project expenditure over the past five years has reached about $7 billion.
Kepler measurement of the rotation speed of the stars of the Stonecutters
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete stars of the Cylon star rotation speed.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why the star's star has a different spin speed and the connection between the rotation and the planet.
"We want to compare our results with other clusters to learn more about the relationship between star quality, age, and even the history of our solar system," he said at a news conference.
Aung San Suu Kyi is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 1.25 billion years ago and has just reached adulthood.
They have reached the highest rate of rotation in their lifetime.
At the highest rate of rotation, these mature stars emit large amounts of stellar winds.
When these stellar winds pass through the star's magnetic field, they will have a brake effect on the star.
As the age of the star increases, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler was able to measure the rotation speed of the stars by tracking the time of the recognizable star black (like sunspot).
The latest spin speed data sets show that the larger star's rotation rate is slower than that of smaller stars.
Leibull compares the star to the dancer and the larger dancer spins at a slower pace than a smaller dancer.
"In the 'ballet performance' of the Cylon, we find that the slower stars tend to have a larger mass, while the fastest growing stars tend to be the lightest stars.
Due to the proximity of the Cylon cluster, it can be used as an ideal universe laboratory for the comparison of star quality and rotation speed.
"The Cylons have laid the groundwork for a two-way rotational theoretical model for young and elderly stars."
We still have a lot of knowledge about how the stars, when and why slow down and "pick up their own dance shoes."
Redmond and her colleagues elaborated on their latest analysis of the rotation speed of the Cylons in three new papers, which will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
Zheng Jianjun, chief of the water management section of the South Lake Park, said that the depth of the water at the bottom of the South Lake was more than 10 meters, and it was very likely that the water would be in danger.
"Although the South Lake rescue team is very professional, it is hoped that the vast number of boating visitors will be able to put on a life jacket and do not make illegal actions on the lake, safe play," said Zheng Jianjun.
The surrounding village has a unique marine environment, sitting in the natural ecology and humanistic ecological two leisure tourism resources.
"But the individual owners who bought the parking spaces, fearing that it would affect their parking prices, also suspect that others have a private heart, so they have been damaged by the back, causing the parking lot to be put on hold."
In the case of when the potato is introduced to this problem, the theory of the academic community is still mixed.
In the current mainstream view, the introduction of the sweet potato has three main lines.
Among the three routes introduced by the sweet potato, the largest and most widely spread, Chen Zhenlong was introduced by the Philippines.
The management office of the Beijing municipal social group will conduct a special inspection on the use of the unified collection of contributions to social groups.
The inspection is divided into two types of self-examination and focus on the unit.
According to the head of the relevant departments of the municipal associations, the scope of this inspection includes the social groups for the unified receipt of social group contributions by the municipal associations in the period from 2013 to 2015.
"The success of the Olympic Games is defined by people who share the story on social media," the Rio organizing committee said in a strategy for the Olympic Games.
According to the report of the Olympic Games, the media has made a lot of changes in the mode of communication, product form, language style, news perspective and so on.
The International Olympic Committee and media practitioners from around the world seem to have come to meet this challenge.
On August 11, the Guangda Securities H shares went on sale for the last day. There was news that the market for the first two days of the stock market was muted. According to the plan, it will be listed in Hong Kong on August 18.
According to a domestic brokerage analyst, Oriental Securities is not good at the base of the port, and its management business is the director of the East. It is not uncommon for banks such as UBS International and CITIC Securities.
Experts point out that this year, with the return of the securities market, there has been a decline in the performance of many brokerage firms, but it is not possible to generalize about the development of the company's own business after the listing.
After the introduction of the new deal, Suzhou will become the first second-line city in the country to restart the purchase.
The second-line cities that have introduced or are about to introduce property control policies are more than Suzhou, including Hefei and Nanjing, and other cities.
Previously, Hefei has taken the lead in issuing a lending policy, and the bank will refuse to provide mortgage services for buyers who have two apartments in Hefei and have a housing loan outstanding.
