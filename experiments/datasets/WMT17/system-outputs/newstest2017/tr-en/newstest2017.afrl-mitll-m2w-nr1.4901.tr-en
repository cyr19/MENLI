28 Responses to Help the dead in the San Francisco shopping centre
The 28-year-old cook, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in his home in a local shopping centre later this week.
The victim's brother, however, did not think that he could be the one who might want to hurt her, adding: "in the end, things were going well for him."
The bodies of San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, 28, were found at the Westfield shopping centre on Wednesday morning, authorities said.
San Francisco police have determined that the cause of death is homicide, and research continues.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, of the ABC station in San Francisco, had previously been working as the chief of the kitchen division in Boston, where he was hired six months ago to work as chief of the kitchen department at the San Francisco 49ers, he said.
Sons & Co., who was also the reverse official, stated that the deaths were "hard and very sad."
"we are a small team working like a hard family here and he will be very miss," the spokesman said.
This is the tough time Frank's family are not alone, and our prayers are with them.
Louis Galicia, Frank was initially staying in hostels, he said, and "finally, things were good for him."
Louis Galicia, said, "I kept an apartment and was out with a girl.
Louis Galicia has said that he does not think he could be the one who might want to hurt his younger brother.
That was a huge heart, which was a gentle one.
The way to bond with the family was always to prepare a plate for us, to eat us, "said Louis Galicia.
Attempts would never be like getting to the vaccines.
My brother, were in compliance with every situation.
"all the other things in the world went up," he said, adding that he was a virgin for every day.
The owner of the information, 415-444-444, was asked to search for the SFPD bar from the phone.
Assist doctors on strike: calls for new business to slow down
Assist the representatives of the doctors in connection with the dispute about a new contract to allow the unions to slow down their business.
The Association of British Tablets (BMA) Asks Doctors Committee (JDC) has called on the general council to support the action to slow down more business from the beginning of September.
JDC said the ministers had failed to address concerns about the contract.
Assist doctors and medical students in the rejection of the contract agreement with BMA.
This was rejected by 58% of the members who voted.
In a tweet on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC president, Knudsen McCourt, stated that the government remained "silent" on the problems caused by the rejection of the contract.
In light of this, he said: "in light of this, the JDC board voted to reject the proposed new contract and called for a resumption of formal negotiations on concerns."
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board has submitted a formal request to the BMA Board to allow a programme to slow down business from the beginning of September.
The dispute prompted the rebels to join six strikes, including the first total cut in the history of the Nation this year.
Dr Johann Malawana, the leader of the rebels in Bma, resigned after the BMA voted against the terms of the proposed contract.
54,000 rebels and medical students voted during the preceding meetings to give BMA members a good deal that should be considered.
After the vote, the Health Minister, Jeremy Hunt, stated that the contract would apply to doctors in Great Britain.
Russia and Turkey: a 'alignment' alliance?
This was a gesture that terminated the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met to shake hands on Tuesday and announce the official end of the eight-month war with the word and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart at the crowded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, it was obvious that Ankara was the most willing to compromise.
Handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile was quite weakened, and even against his own limited standards, he cannot be said to have spread any temperature.
Unlike several times, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke of his "good friend" Mr. Putin; five times, according to a report.
I am surprised by the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not return to the pre-crisis level, much higher levels.
The next day, a newspaper here said that Mr. Erdogan had never been acting like a bad thing.
I think he was the opposite of the excitement of it.
But in the cold intifada around Mr. Putin, the Russian leader showed that he had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing mentioned in the opening was the reason for the crisis: the shot of the Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Was then filled with the response of Russia.
Mr. Putin, by a sharp exit, accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
After a lot of fuss, the opposing side seemed to be friendly.
Confidence that it will be difficult to truly rebuild, perhaps impossible.
Since November, the idea of the people of Russia has changed.
The state-controlled media has targeted Ankara in a staggering and aggressive way for several months.
Suddenly, everything was criminal Turks.
The most serious of these was the accusation that senior officials of Mr. Erdogan's family profit from illegal oil trade carried out in areas under the control of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
Himself definitively denied it.
But the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to continue the path.
Ultimately, the reason for this meeting was that Mr. Putin had received the apology demanded from the president.
Russia can see it as a sort of victory.
Benefits for a ceasefire call for Ankara are very clear.
But first, he needs friends after the failed coup, which took place last month and which will almost take over.
Repeat in itself highly influenced by the terrorist attacks.
Also effective for economic reasons.
The sanctions imposed by Russia are hard hit; especially the prohibition of private flights carrying a few million Russian tourists to the coastal areas of Turkey each year.
That number has dropped by almost 90%.
The tour operators and leasing companies in Russia are certainly relieved with the fact that the flights will continue.
On the intensity of the end of the season in the Mediterranean.
And earlier this week, state television predicted a decrease in the prices of fruit and vegetables, with a rebound in the import of Turkish agricultural products.
"tourists are there, tomatoes are there."
The visit, however, was also available in a separate political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for failing to find sufficient response to the coup d'Ã©tat.
The talks on joining the United States have also been added to anger over a long time due to the progress of the countryside, with Turkey breaking off ties with the West and seeking to take advantage of the standoff with Mr. Putin.
The Russian leader seems to have gathered sympathy from Ankara, certainly due to the call for the support of elected officials following the coup attempt.
Not to forget, he himself was carrying a profound fear of regime change for Moscow, which was an inevitable position.
This summit, which is held at the seaside this crowded palace, represents a "alignment alliance" between Russia and Turkey in the way an analyst tells me: the West refuses and is acting poorly.
Despite this consensus, though, they are quite different from each other.
One of the most important of them is about Syria: Moscow itself as a mediator, but Russia and Turkey support different sides.
After almost three hours of initial talks, the two speaker didn't address this issue at the press conference, as he supports it.
The President has openly avoided answering a question regarding these differences, while Mr. Putin chose to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on how to set the common ground in Syria.
But after months of clear animosity - and that of a member of that Russian fighter plane hit and dropped, the potential for absolute disaster exists - at least the two leaders begin to speak, at least in a good development.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside of Scotland
The RBS brand, according to the chief executive of the bank, will be in the rear office position.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be destroyed for customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan said the BBC Scotland RBS brand is associated with the global goals of the bank.
Almost west of the state eight years ago, to withdraw from them and to give up.
During this time, brand strategy experts used RBS to protect other consumer financial brands.
This was supported by millions of pounds for many sponsors from the six nation Ragbi championships to the Wimbledon Andy Murray championship.
But now, however, the discovery of more national brands will be right.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers but there will be no new beginnings.
The centre and the Welsh centre and the stock exchange on the condition that all references to RBS will be replaced as NatWest.
Already used in the Ulster Bank brand for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
The individual banking will assume a much more dominant task for smaller brands in the current; Coutts, Adam & Co., Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed in a round of competition for customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
Speaking to BBC Scotland, he said: "we will now become a bank consisting mainly of brands, we will no longer be brand investors and our staff will not be the brand of employment."
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I say it is no longer global, but our local goals.
Also, each of these brands will be put forward in a slightly different way on the community, and our staff will work under the name of these brands with customers.
RBS will not continue sponsoring the six nation championships, and it is time to raise the profile of different brands on sports sponsorship.
"now the brands have time to move to understanding the bank because (we have asked ourselves) how can a better bank do it for customers," said the executive board.
Three years ago, we will be a wonderful bank for customers and we have stated that we will offer these brands to those who will find it.
Through our work, however, and not our own, I think you will see too many changes with the focus on the needs of customers.
We can put these brands back in place, so I think this is the right time.
Frankie Dettori, with which he gained the Newmarket with the victory, won the 3000th
Detail of the double success of the Newmarket with the victory of 3000th after the champagne exploded
Jodie Frankie Dettori won the 3000th victory in Britain on Friday in the Newmarket.
The local track, trained by John Gosden, won his second victory of the night with the announcement of this milestone.
Italian, 45, was the sixth rider to reach this milestone in the hurdles.
He was followed by the traces of himself, Gordon Richards, Zug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie at last.
Jodie, who had previously won three titles in Ghayyar, said: "this is a special situation."
I'm very emotional because it is here in my family
I was really very happy to be on the Newmarket when I started this 30 years ago.
This is not an important meeting, not a Royal Ascot - with just 20,000 people on an ordinary Friday night.
I feel at ease and feel relieved.
Detectives, following the victory, accepted the cheers by bringing the
Disabled runners became the first to reach this milestone in two jets: champion Joins Richard Johnson and 20 time champion, and with a record of over 4300 victories in his career, retired Joins Anthony McCoy.
Lester Piggott, who won the Derby race nine times in his career, has a 4493 victory
Frankie is one of the best comics of our age, and it's not surprising that he reached a milestone when he was only a few people before him.
Style is the owner and a strong person, but the scales have the element that is heavier than others in the tactical mentality.
He himself represents an extraordinary way of racing, in this regard, to recognize the excitement and darkness of people with this sport.
Just a few weeks ago, I was told that I could have reached the 6000th victory if I were to go to Frankie just on weekends and competing in the big races.
Seriously, to be serious, Frankie competed in the United Kingdom with a big part of the 30 year victories that it was very nice to see.
He is quite a character himself, and this is a very good feature for British racing but beyond that it is an extraordinary feat.
Frankie Dettori, who had become a symbol of this milestone, celebrated with the movement of horses at
To finish off the competition, the horses, from the horses to their jobs, move in as many as Frankie Dettori has become a symbol of British hurdles for twenty years.
This is a path that has had its ups and downs.
In 1996, he won several major races, including the famous' Great Yin 'victory, but was left alive in a plane crash and banned due to failure to comply with the drug ban.
Three years ago these six months of divergence were particularly difficulties during his return to the process, but those who suspected him were unfair and needed to return to the best of a strong character.
And may continue for a while; Dettori previously said he wanted to continue the contest until at least the age of 50.
Russian president Putin, special had Sergei Ivanov dismissed the
President Vladimir Putin, the special had Sergei Ivanov unexpectedly dismissed.
Mr. Ivanov, for many years, was part of Mr. Putin's trusted close.
63, now as special representative for environmental and transportation issues.
In a statement, the Kremlin said in a statement that Mr. Putin "made the decision to end Ivanov as chief of the administration of Russia" but did not give any reason.
For this position to Mr. Ivanov since 2012, Anton Vaino.
Vaino, 44 years old, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia in 1972, graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the embassy of Tokyo.
He later became interested in the administration of the presidential protocol and government personnel; the wording of the Kremlin website is in this shape (Russian).
After the deployment, Mr. Putin said: "thank you for your trust in me."
I think that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as the head of the state in terms of auditing the enforcement of the law and the enforcement of the instructions.
Mr. Putin said Friday he wanted the removal of Mr. Ivanov from the Russian television station and proposed to Mr. Vaino instead.
Smile convincing?
This is a move that shocked Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov, for a long time, was working as one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, the security forces of the KGB.
Especially as he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
During a meeting with Putin and aired on state television, both said they had voluntarily dismissed the special stay.
Despite the smiling parts given to the cameras, however, very few people here are convinced of it; especially at this time of the parliamentary elections.
Is this a kind of ruling from a dispute?
Nobody knows about it yet.
The official statement, however, was greeted with great suspicion that a person could be president to direct Russia's environmental policy.
According to excerpts from the Kremlin website, Mr. Ivanov added: "in a speech in early 2012, you can say this is tough - even problematic - I wanted you to count on me for four years for the task.
Well, apparently, four years, eight months, I served as the head private.
Mr. Ivanov assumed this post in December 2011.
He had previously held positions of deputy prime minister and defence ministry.
Himself, a member of the Security Council and former member of the KGB state security forces, such as Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, Mr. Putin was replaced by the KGB, the head of the Federal Security Forces (FSB), while Mr. Ivanov was acting him.
When Mr. Putin came to power, Ivanov was shown as one of the five most trusted people.
Mr. Putin also presided over the third period in which it was unconstitutional that Mr. Ivanov might be president after the second term of Mr. Putin.
However, his task was transferred to another close ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency three and a half years later.
CRIMINAL Minds series star Thomas is the last of the producers to hit the chase after
Last month, the last of the series in Los Angeles became involved in a physical fight.
ABC has produced the series, and CBS Television, a joint statement, announced that he was fired.
Special Ajit Aaron Hotchner, who was the last of the last, ahead of the announcement, issued an apology on Tuesday.
Differences on the creative issues of the set and a dispute is available.
"I regret that such an incident took place," he said.
ABC Studios and CBS Television is reporting that the character, played by the last of a group of FBI agents, will be removed from the program following detailed information on how the program will be issued at a time in the future.
The 54-year-old actor, who had previously been involved in the situation at Dharma & Greg, was not involved in the programme since his first season in 2005.
"I love CRIMINAL Minds, and I have worked with him for the last twelve years, giving him my heart and soul," said the last of the statements issued on Friday.
I would love to stay until the end but this is no longer possible.
I just want to thank the authors, the producers, the actors, our wonderful team, and most importantly, the best supporters who could have a schedule.
The schedule for the second season is expected to return to the screen on September 28.
Banff the mystery of the fish in the garden
A person who lives in the Banff area has applied for help to define the fish that originated in the yard in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that this 75 fish could be transported with a sea of sand fish.
Bain, who lives 500 m away from the sea, has published the footage, hoping to shed light on the emergence of someone's two-long fish.
Pass Pass: the bridge is now conditioned to Fife
Â£1.35 billion worth of the project must be completed by May 2017
Engineers have joined the north and the north of the Northwest Territories; this means that the bridge is now tied to Fife.
This is the first of the four shutters between the "cylinders" which are to be completed around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge is cut from Fife 600 metres long and weigh 30,000 tons.
10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
The project, worth 1.35 billion, must be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the facilities today, one of the first people to walk from the land bridge.
Said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Northwest Passage.
We all bridge over 30,000 tons of concrete used for the construction of this part of the project, with this project truly epic scale engineers.
Maintaining the gap between the base of the bridge and the base of the bridge, despite the extraordinary size and weight of the bridge, is a sensitive work that requires very delicate tolerance for this adjustment.
In general, almost 79% of the total bridge base has been settled, meaning that the first cut of the coffin will be carried out in the concrete washroom today, which means that the entire plate will be ready to be removed on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing and Bridge Developers project, said: "all bridge projects, the first closing is always an important milestone.
This extraordinary project, this closing, represents the predecessors of construction engineers.
We had to close the gap on the north-or-side of the road, which was also placed on the last road base and after the widening North Tower level.
In the north, this was carried out to the south by 700 millimetres.
This is very large but also a very delicate function.
The major reason is that the vulture is 222 metres long, weighing almost 6,000 tons and was required to pull out about 3%.
Delicate part of the reason why the team was suited to comply with the values was very low; it was only a few millimetres on both sides.
Fortunately, everything went on.
Moelfre Gulf rescue team: three men are lucky to be alive in
The three men were "lucky to be alive" after their fall from the fishing boat in Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI watchdogs were on the alert at 13: 20 a.m. on Friday, after the car was tipped to see the case in the Gulf of Moelfre.
The three men were striving to swim towards a safe area while their craft continued on its own.
"we have seen the boat draw the right apartments for them, and we have anxiety," said Moelfre watchman.
"fortunately, we were away with strong winds until we set them right," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat while the third man, 60, had fallen tired, even though he had fallen tired of a shaman without being found.
All the way towards the shore of the watchtower, and the watchman was brought to the station
Mr Jones said: "the three men who crashed into the water were lucky because they were alive and never was hurt.
The boat engines had an emergency stop cable but when it came to the boat, one of the people using the boat should have been cut off.
Watching someone of these three men today.
A valuable form of hunting for health and happiness, PokÃ©mon Go
It's really a shock to see how the world has changed.
When young people and children are no longer playing out for the game, choosing to spend their empty time on the screen, most people feel sorry for the last ten years.
Pokemon Go people are encouraged to move up from the wings.
The time spent by looking at the screen, especially when they were limited to television, eventually video games and finally the smart phones spread to them.
For that reason, it's really great to see that there are no elements that exclude each other in technology and open air.
In the course of the 90's, of course, I was talking about PokÃ©mon Go, which was originally created for the video game (then turned into cartoon series, game cards and other side products).
Just like a lot of the popular culture, this new game was introduced in early July when it was presented in the US, Australia and New Zealand.
I then postponed the presentation in other countries due to the intense interest caused by overloading the servers.
In the days PokÃ©mon Go Tinder is more and more and almost the same number of users with Twitter.
How does it work?
To explain briefly, the players are taking smart phones, followed with GPS in the way they look for PokÃ©mon, and can upload a photo of the timer (by phone) or catch them on the phone. '
The game can be traced back to the search for a generation who has participated in this madness.
In the United States, the game has provided a remarkable increase in the number of steps taken each day by an "average" person.
The application, which was developed for Apple Watch, and which was developed for 375,000 users, was introduced in the Washington Post shortly before the game was presented to people trailing within two days of 30 days of exercise each day, from 45 percent to 53 percent, the person said.
The company does not know who PokÃ©mon Go plays; you can only see crude data at the exercise level.
The most public health campaign, which encourages people to "disappear from the blood of 30 minutes," and "to be active every day," most public health campaigners ignore the fact that most public health message is boring and overwhelmed by people who seem to be overwhelmed by it.
But still, the importance of exercises is less than stress.
Regular exercise, people who are suffering from cancer or depression is reduced.
The exercise, of control, helps issues such as high blood pressure and diabetes, and has a long list of benefits that cannot be listed here.
PokÃ©mon Go's beauty, however, is that people come out to do something they enjoy.
In this way the health is covered in three essential elements: movement, clean air, and entertainment with sunlight.
Some people can even be new friends during the hunting.
As usual, there are those without walls searching for something to complain about.
And, of course, one can hit the pavement.
What makes the difference?
Presented a great innovation.
Fitflex is watching our offensive smart phone practices, such as this game, but did not offer us a reason to exercise like that.
The impact of defeat and use will eventually be reduced.
However, due to the success of PokÃ©mon, practices and virtual reality in the real world activities combine to combine with those that are more active, form and healthy, which will help in many games.

Simone Biles covered the gold in the women's gymnastics general assessment
Forget about the pressure.
Forget about the excitement.
Similar to all of them, there are tons of donations.
Jumping on the dynamic.
Comfortable in the balance.
Place with shock.
Especially down the slope.
And he is no longer an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast, who also completed his overall assessment Thursday, made it clear the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympics.
All in all, 62.198 points were awarded to the silver medal winner and a fellow of the "Last five" team, ALY Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafaj.
Simone Biles from the United States of America performed the balance in the women's figure gymnastics general evaluation final at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles took the overall assessment award in the back of the fourth and became the fifth American woman in general, and his own, and perhaps the best of all time.
I burst into tears when the last total was released, and it turned out to be the main goal that ended the long travel.
This success has brought the sport to new levels, bringing the sport to new levels, which could be seen once in every generation, with athletes such as Michael Phelps at the same level:
He went on to win 15 world championships medals, including 10 of his last three years of gold, and the 1984 Olympic champion, Mary Lou Retreton, described him as "the best gymnast I've ever seen," with a mixture of ambitions and precision as one of the most successful in this sport.
Brazil is the latest in a test of it; this competition went far from being among other people in the area with him and great expectations of the burden.
Been in Spring, the family home with less than a handful of gold medals would be regarded as a disappointment.
Simone Biles, left, and ALY Raisman from the United States, left, and ALY Raisman are on Thursday, after receiving a gold and silver medal at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Brazil.
Biles won on Tuesday as a sign of his farewell party co-ordinator, Marolyi Karolyi, a retired national team co-ordinator.
Went to the summit to insist that you never look forward to this long run, although this is not exactly true.
Part of the exercises that become the symbol of the cliff, including the passage of the pimp, will fully adapt to the street outside the Rio Olympic Arena with the Latin music of the article.
This is not a coincidence.
The girl was discovered by her great mother and her great father, and Aimee Boorman, who was adopted by her mother in a gymnastics salon on the tour, became a force when she was discovered by her mother.
He has not lost one of his overall evaluations since the summer of 2013; this went on as long as he wanted a win in the series.
Although he took over the leadership of the two routes, Mustafic said it was ephemeral.
Billions of world title balance equipment and place exercises have not yet been done.
The balance was put forward with a score of 15.433 points, and the exercises included it with a score of 15.933.
Raising his kindness while waiting for the final score, Raisman hugged him at ease, and went on to say that once a smear of his vision was real, the glow of red, white and blue appeared around the corner of the eye.
Raisman's performance was like a rematch four years earlier, when he shared the fourth, but later lost to Mustafic.
This time, the captain of the team, 22, called the Americans "Nine."
He looked suspicious at the time when he was overcome with a return to the place where he kissed the crowd.
While Biles, 19, shared many shared tweets earlier this week, now is an entirely new mean:
Police: serial killer case of 3 victims, shot while listening to music in the car
Phoenix's first serial killer in ten years, two women and a 12-year-old girl, spoke in the car on Thursday, according to police reports, and was shot while listening to music.
The officials said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephenson R. Ellis and Ellis, the daughter of Maleah, had been shot in the car on the way to a garage on June 12.
The report said the gunman was standing on the passenger side of the car and fired eight shots with the pistol and another vehicle away.
Police say these three murders did not appear to be robbery because the aggressive adult victims had no money in their handbag or $2,900.
Deputy commissioner Jonathan Howard, a spokesman for Phoenix police, said the armed attack researchers were directed to examine whether it was linked to the previous four attacks.
Four months in total, seven people were killed and two others wounded in nine attacks, mainly in the neighborhood of Spanish origin.
Howard said at the beginning of this month that the CBS subsidiary KPHO was in the residential area in front of a house. "
Key in the late 1990s, a model of brown Nissan was thought to have been driven by a few vehicles, including a model of black BMW and a white Cadillac or of the late 1990s.
The researchers declined to reveal the evidence, which concluded that the attacks were related to the same killer and that it was carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to hospital because of his injuries and subsequently died.
Liner (31) and Ellis's daughter Maleah died at the scene.
Speaking to a person who was involved in the incident, police said these people were sitting in the car parked in a regular offline situation.
At the same time, authorities also released a police report on the incident, which resulted in a fire targeting an empty truck half an hour before the three murders.
The researchers found those bullets, a bullet from a couch, and also bullet holes in the engine.

Like most of his six year old children, Edmund Picciuto is also singing, toys and, of course, his mother, too.
Unlike his peers, however, Edmund exists in the lodge; this is a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, is not aware of its existence during the onset of puberty.
When I first came home, I wasn't able to do it in my first thought.
I wasn't able to do that.
I did not want it.
These are not true, of course, but it is also the highlight of the course, "he said.
He and his wife, Vincent, were told that Edmund could never recognise them and could not even survive.
I went so far as to suggest that some doctors would offer to be invested in the care home.
Picciuto "first reaction was to say that I do not think people are doing it anymore.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walk.
Edmund was unable to sit upright until the age of three, or his retirement, and still unable to speak.
But he slowly reaches some turning points.
Assistance can walk and ride by bicycle.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth, Edmund, indicates the language of the dreamer, which means "please sing to me."
Picciuto, CBS News, said to him, "I have taught him the language of
This is not the language of the sign, as we know, however, that Edmund has made up his own signs.
Mikroefali may arise due to a number of different situations; a genetic defect such as Edmund may be present in a genetic situation, and during the raw materials, such as the daughter and Zika, can be derived from infections.
Symptoms and the onset of the disease can show huge differences.
Zika infection in the life of people who would be affected by this situation is rather premature.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden posed by the uncertainty of the future.
I constantly ask what will happen.
What will happen?
And he still does not know it.
In fact, I did not expect anyone to really say to me that I did not have a question about the disease for a long time.
Picciuto, however, has been able to offer lots of hope for the mothers of premature babies whose apology is due to Zika.
Getting better.
You know it will be better for you.
If you love your child, your child will love you.
Louisiana, Mississippi, where intense rain and water raids have panicked
Heavy rain and widespread water raids in Louisiana were directed to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected by Saturday.
The National Air Conditioning Services reported that the youngsters burst into numerous rivers in northeast Louisiana and Mississippi, and that it was in danger of widespread water raid following intense rain flow.
Louisiana Governor John Bel made a statement that state officials repeatedly had contacts with local officials and expressed support for the neighborhood affected by the situation.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the governor's Office of Domestic Security and Emergency Preparations, said the high water vehicles, boats and trenches had been in demand.
Steele has only been requested by tonnes of trenches for the neighbourhood, Steele said.
Saturday will be imposed on a water raid nurse in most of southern Louisiana.
Depending on the weather services, an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall, he said.
Southern but, in the Mobile area, the rain continued on Saturday, when a water raid nurse was available.
AMITE Rivers, near Baton Rouge, both in Louisiana and near Denham Springs, is expected to reach record levels during the week.
An official said Alek Krautmann could leave many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge on both sides of the river.
He himself, also full of rivers, will be slow to flow into the Lake of Ascension, a threat to the flow of water in the neighbourhood.
Liverpool, Louisiana, just south of the Mississippi provincial border, the Tickfaw River, measured at 9 in the morning, was already reached to minimize the load, said Friday.
Rescue teams are continuing to rescue people from water raids in AMITE and Wilkinson accidents in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson, were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said the water from the Beaver Derby, normally 400 feet away from his home, had risen rapidly in the night.
Sitting nearby, another steward warned him of his son.
"we woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
Up to the resort.
His wife, Hansford, lived here for 48 years, the highest level he had seen in the magazine.
Hansford said that he and his family were disabled, and that he was the only one that could swim.
Hanson said three of the emergency workers rescued a truck in large, military style and took refuge on Friday at the fire station in Gloster.
Krautmann said that as the heavy rains continue, water raids are "rapidly spreading," and authorities are considering issuing an evacuation order.
Krautmann said an observation near Livingston was reported to have received 13.75 inches of rain Friday morning after midnight.
Krautmann said the ground has been high since Wednesday.
Authorities said the streets, which had been under heavy rains and water raid, came to the rescue of residents of Tangija neighbourhood and the need for schools in five schools in the area.
CBS subsidiary WWL, a female municipal council member in Tangionoa, reported that 200 houses remained under the water raid.
The residents were evacuated, and two were taken to church but they are now under the water raid.
Neighbourhood Officer Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals, who were stranded due to rising waters.
The town of AMITE and Hammond opened shelters for people who were evacuated from the city.
He said to himself, "When Waters starts to withdraw, he will be allowed to return home."
Meanwhile, in Hammond, the neighborhood of Tangionoa, almost two dozen streets were closed due to rising waters, and water was to be supplied by residents trying to keep their homes and businesses away.
"what we face is the latest major water raid in March," city administrative chief Lacy Landrum said.
Looks like this will be a similar event.
Mississippi, high-profile Kazakh emergency director Rupert Lacy said the rain in comparison to the Gulf has remained stable.
A few homes were reported to be in the water raid on Tuesday but so far for Friday, there has been no reporting in that direction.
Keith Campbell, executive director of the AMITE in Shopper, has been living in this area for 40 years.
"I saw the water in places I had never seen before," he said, and added, "and there is still rain."
"6-year-old Mahaj Brown, whose body was found in a hole with bullet wounds, was alive from the Philadelphia attack
Police said the boy, 6 years old, was shot in Philadelphia, this week in the city, where he shot a 6 year old boy in the second incident.
CBS Philadelphia for Mahaj Brown identified his grandfather and grandfather.
Brown said his grandfather and grandfather, Brown's body, had multiple firearms injuries in areas containing the tape area, legs, legs, and stomach but were brought to the hospital while awareness was on the ground.
His grandfather, Delores Melendez, said in a statement that the station "suffered a lot of pain, prefabricated fuselage with bullet holes."
I can hardly believe it.
The boy was listed among those who maintain the critical condition of the hospital and some of the surgeries.
Family, to the station, he was expected to improve.
Would start the first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was among the four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Two men, one of 29, were also shot at the age of 32.
CBS Philadelphia, 29, said one of the men was in critical condition, while the other two victims were in stable condition.
After restoration, the boy was reported to be in the front seat of a car along with one of the 29-year-old men who were critical of the situation.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the injured was aggressive.
Detectives said CBS Philadelphia could have fired multiple gunmen at each other.
The location of the incident was filled with bullets in the style of attack weapons that belonged to different offensive weapons.
Definitely had a lasting conflict, apparently.
Street and sidewalks are available on both sides of the fence.
This shows that there are multiple armed assailants, and both are active, "Philadelphia commissioner Anthony Gjindi told them at the station.
Multiple homes and vehicles in the region have also been damaged.
Many arrests have happened, and police have reportedly been studying security cameras.
Once again, at the age of 6, a girl was shot in the arm with an accident while playing in front of her home in the West Oak neighbourhood on Tuesday.
Himself in the recovery process and the police are still searching for a suspect.
Similarly, Gabby and Laurie are the reason we need to
I got this name from the Women's Olympic Gymnastics team this year, and there are multiple reasons for this.
First of all, I have participated in the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant before.
The second one: this team has three gymnastics that inspire many girls with different ethnic backgrounds: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie."
The Jewish ALY Raisman and the Catholic Madison husband were brought together by the parents of everyone in the structure of this team.
Team, a similar look to America at the end.
It also strengthens the presence of black and Latino women at the top levels of this sport.
Over the last four years, the first female gymnast always became an American of African descent.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2nd.
This is a powerful thing.
Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America supported him.
All the world's three World Champion, Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie, are the ones who may be the only ones to have an unexpected but masters gymnastics performance.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win a gold medal in the overall assessment of women.
And teammate ALY Raisman also won a silver medal.
This is the best time to witness the sport but the situation in gymnastics courses throughout the country does not seem to be the case.
Similarly, Gabby and Laurie followed suit with ALREADY and Madison in order to get involved in the Olympic team.
The reason for the "last courses" is that the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts, and it is the last year that Marta Karolyi will become instructor.
In reality, however, gymnastics is a costly sport and gymnasts are primarily paid for by parents, education, travel, the competition, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and families), and many more are supported by private gymnastics clubs.
Most of these gymnastics clubs can support these businesses, located in the wealthy suburban neighbourhoods.
These clubs are the only place where gymnasts can receive training and require a long-term commitment to the families of the gymnastics.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Muller, the defending champion, said these athletes have been trained since they began their gymnastics.
Similarly, we will not offer more reasonably priced and accessible gymnastics training to communities for countless young girls who have been affected by Gabby and Laurie.
I set up my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
Since the inception of our agency, the nostalgic look at over 15,000 young people in the city (primarily black and Hispanic), we offer free and low cost gymnastics training, and we have done the same to both national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (where I grew up) to offer quality gymnastics training to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn about this wonderful Olympic sport and take advantage of it.
Gymnastics, the strengthening of the body, flexibility and coordination, and mental aspects of hard work, discipline and determination characteristics.
This combination presents long-term advantages for success in health care, at school and in the workplace.
Thousands of young daughters will be directed to gymnastics, which will inspire this team, and this is a wonderful thing.
Participation in sports activities is very important, especially for girls.
We're going through the really exciting times.
Simone, ALREADY, Laurie, Gabby and Madison took the gold as an Olympic team and made it clear to many of their young daughters that they were motivated by their different background plans to become a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
After the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's offer, the doctors decided to continue the strike
The ministers hoped that the agreement on the contract developed with the officers of the British Tablets will end after the dispute was reached, but the vote of the 37,000 ascent doctor who participated in the vote was 58 per cent.
In July, Mr. Hunt announced plans to impose sanctions on the contract, claiming that the NHS is "not the property of anyone," and that there will be further delays in staff and patients.
The first phase of the physician group was passed into the new contract, which included changes in working practices during the night and late in the week in order to improve the look outside of normal hours.
Dr Knudsen McCourt, chairman of the committee of doctors of the Bma, said yesterday: "there are still serious concerns in connection with the proposed contract with the doctors; in particular, it will trigger the current workforce crisis, and not all doctors are in an equal position."
With the passage of the new contract, the first physician group must ensure progress in this process, remaining only eight weeks, and to be full of time.
The efforts to resolve the dispute by talking to Bma were met with the government's unwillingness to interact and, in some cases, with disturbing voices.
This is a development seen in spite of Jeremy Hunt's promise that he will always be open to the door last month.
"Jeremy Hunt is just about to take action, lift my sanctions and listen to the anxieties of the doctors."
Assured doctors are prepared to increase their actions to slow down the business if they do not do so.
During the last strike, which took place at the end of April, almost 13.2 thousand routine operations and 100,000 appointment postponed, nurses and consultants were forced to look instead of doctors in the strike line.
The ministers hoped that the agreement on the contract developed with the officers of the British Battalion will end after the dispute is over.
Bma wants to improve their fees over the weekend for 54,000 rebels, the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mora, executive director of the NHS Employers' Association, urged the rebels not to implement any strike.
Mr Mora said: "the strike is not going to solve anything but the pressure on the already busy team and services, creating pressure on the patients, the nursing staff and their families, would be uncomfortable and cause shortages."
During the last two months we have continued our discussions with the Committee of Experts, and together with the Ministry of Health and other officials, we have a positive approach to the anxieties and concerns associated with the Watchdog Bullets.
Employers are hopeful that the continuation of positive communication in connection with key issues - such as distribution, educational flexibility, training costs for those who break into their careers - is consistent with the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February, February and May, a sign that employers have taken seriously what is being taken by the UK Medical Training and Health Ministry.
2 pounds a day will be able to eliminate the danger of heart attack medication
The authorities have proposed granting more people for a longer period of time after thousands of heart attack patients could benefit from the 2 pounds of expensive drugs a day.
Crossing the tracks, preventing people from having a heart defect, reduce the risk of a repeat crisis.
Lowering the risk of a heart attack is given over the course of 12 months and can reduce the risk of paralysis or another crisis.
Regarding the NHS monitoring, NICE has proposed that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, the NHS observers have proposed that NICE be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Every year around 140.000 people in the UK are having a heart attack and a quarter of them are suffering from another crisis or paralysis.
The cause of heart crises and stymites is the accumulation of fat in the lining of the walls.
If the record is falling apart, this is caused by the blood clinging to the heart, which may lead to a heart attack.
And if the tracks were snapped up, the flow of blood in the brain blocked the flow of blood in case of paralysis.
Those who had previously undergone a crisis are more at risk of having another crisis.
United Kingdom firm AstraZeneca was created with the name Brilique commercial name, reducing the risk of passing the tracks, reducing this risk.
A draft of the NICE manual, published today, proposes to implement 60 mg, along with individuals for 12 months, and then again for three years, twice a day for three years.
Professor Carole Longlast, executive director of the Nice health technology evaluation centre, said: "effective secondary prevention treatments exist, but as many as a quarter of those who have a heart attack are suffering from another heart attack or paralysis, and usually their results are devastating."
Again, the fear is to be able to have a fairly negative impact on the quality of life of the person.
The evidence shows that the use of Justice, along with the vaccine, is effective in reducing the risk of heart attack and paralysis in people who had previously suffered a heart attack.
While we are glad to have increased the treatment options offered to thousands of people who are waiting to take advantage of it.
While more than three years of information about the impact and security of the Trade Unit -- particularly blood-risk -- is limited, the guide does not propose treatment after this period.
PC culture has boosted voter fraud in Muslim areas
The former head of the mosque, Lutfi, was removed from his post last year due to corruption following a government report
As shown in the devastating government report presented today, the culture of political truth has led to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities.
Former Cabinet Minister Eric Pickles called on police, election observers and the municipal palace to ignore evidence of electoral abuses due to "extreme sensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
The former community secretary and today's anti-corruption tsar said voters need to be allowed to strip out of the voting cabinet in order to protect voters who fear that police will be intimidated on religious grounds.
Voters have proposed that they be in possession of their identities to prove their identity at the time of the vote.
In the current case, it is sufficient to tell the name and address of the voters.
The report suggests that people vote for the prevention of voting twice, even placing the finger on permanent ink during the voting process.
A better way of protecting those Certificates, Eric said.
He called on council documents and unofficial committees or working groups to better access the information on the decisions.
"this is not only to protect against fraud in elections, but also to protect the local government from the culture of corruption and financial fraud that has dealt with it," he said.
The report was prepared with the instructions of Downing Street in the wake of the concepts presented at the vote scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the resignation of the mayor of Luton, following a repeat of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that the Rahman's Muslim community was "embarrassed by the abuse of their religious feelings," and that critics accused him of racism and Islamophobia.
The "campaign of faithful Muslims was conducted based on the basis of a religious mandate to vote for him."
Up to 300 gaming suspects, or the use of fake identification, were the result of voting, such as those of the president.
Source Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He himself warned about corruption in the vote, especially in postal voting - where the elderly individuals of the Muslim community were pressured to vote for the candidate of their own choosing.
Select Eric, who is to prove that persons who are in possession of their identity in the manner in which the voting system has made some suggestions for
The contents of the report include testimonies: "there is evidence that some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly in their communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
"there are concerns that state institutions ignore such behavior due to" political truth "based on excessive sensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Simultaneously Eric made 50 recommendations for the regulation of the system in the manner in which postal voting documents were blocked in order to "collect the votes" of political activists.
Therefore the report, which was surveyed by Theresa May, also called for a tightening of registration checks to prevent the use of the electoral register as immigration and social assistance fraud.
Identification of voters before deciding on the condition of the option.
Many people vote for the prevention of voting twice after voting for permanent ink on the fingers of the person.
To determine the legality of the vote to be conducted with systematic checks on the nationality of the person.
Automatic mail with a three-year limit to requests for use of the vote.
Political campaign officers and activists have been sent with complete mail of votes and mail sent with the votes to ban the processing of the envelope.
Police, giving the voting cabinet the authority to strip its surroundings.
1983 as part of the Code of Public Prosecutions for releasing the code of conduct for people with bullying.
Voting in the cabinet to photograph the illegal.
The voting cabinet (except for Welsh) is only the talk of English.
Staff to rule that the voters of the cabinet alone sanction the strengthening of education.
A spokesperson for the police mercilessly criticised the police, saying it was "interesting" that any charges were made at the Hamburger case.
"the electoral tribunal has decided that there is no place to charge for repeated allegations of corruption and illegal activities for Lutz Rahman and his representative," he said.
Himself with a series of grounds beyond reasonable suspicion -- seeing the nature of the criminal evidence - was convicted.
He also criticised the "box error checks" that were not effective in the municipal palace's electoral registration department.
"one of the concepts was a warning alarm at last year's court ruling.
Even though our nation has the pride in building the memory of parliaments, this alarming and secret election corruption is underperforming and the rejection by some institutions could lead to the undermining of this good reputation.

Krav MAGA and how you can protect yourself against armed attacks
The outside world is quite dangerous but Dailymail.com can help you secure this video more.
He talked with the chief master of the New York-based Krav MAGAZA Federation, who wanted to learn how to be chief armed robbers from the close.
Whether you are being approached, or from the back, this video shows how you can turn against the situation of the robbers.
Mizrachi, when you are closer to the back of you, first you need to see the aggression on your face and you have to evacuate the line in the fire.
Then put the weapon in your front arm, keeping the gap between you and the light on your face.
When you get into the tape later you will double the pain of the attacker, and at this stage the weapon will be at its best, and even though the weapon is looking at him, the gun barrel will remain in the rear number with the way he will hit the light.
When approaching from the armed person, a similar technique is applied; your body is fired from the fire line, and the attacker can no longer shoot the weapon.
At the same time, giving your weight to the arms of your belly is frightening from the breast region and takes it from behind by confirming the weapon you are behind.
Sounds like you're going to get into it?
Mizrachi was given the video to see how he did it.
Meter; however, if you are not a Krav MAGA master, the safest way to avoid every heist will be to give your money to the robbers.
Traveller Ian Wright travel guide for the language of their most dirty
The British traveller has a serious test of his immune system and items, which contradicts some of Europe's most dirty and disgusting.
The server and tour co-author, Suffer Ian Wright (51), used the language to prove the strength of the immune system, a euro banknotes, a Piccadilly Circus truck, a train toilets, and an anvil in Russia.
Before each object was denied to him and to show us what kind of work he used to be a liar.
But the experiment, which has been transformed into a movie called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Workings, gave some surprising results.
I have spoken to thousands of people in the trenches in a train used by the idea, but the idea is very disgusting but in fact there are far more bad bacteria available in the kitchen.
Mr Wright meets with doctors and medical experts in connection with the increase and health of the mice during his trip in Europe.
Fortunately he denied that nothing was left in his mouth except for the poor taste.
Mr. Wright toured the world and found strange and wonderful things to eat when testing the resilience of his grandfather.
It was one of the general trucks at the station, where they sounded a wide range of toilet trenches to this task, definitely testing the immune system
I said in the movie about it: 'I have not had much attention to my health since I was a child, and I have put many things into my mouth, from the soil, to the left, and into the mud.'
The duration of the film has proved to be the exact cause of this reputation.
The only thing he refused was the dirty mascot toilets in Russia.
Scanning example showed the counting of over 4000 units.
By comparison; in the new wash hands, this number must be less than 60 percent.
But while the new wash was less than 60 feet in the hands of the onlookers, the census refused to lick when over 4000 units became a Russian mascot toilets
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio has produced a tour of The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Workings, showing the number of bacteria in different places, such as bathrooms,
Himself in the movie, he said: 'this is close to being one of the worst things I smell in a toilets.'
I couldn't be more dirty than that!
I will not deny anything that is disgusting on the inside.
The Lickhiker's Guide to the Inner Sphere is prepared together with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Valio Gefilus containing vitamin C and D gear, which helps to strengthen the bacteria and immune system in mice, as well as in mice.
Niko Vuorenmaa, deputy director of Valio's shots, Meyers and Suites and the new Category Division Vice President, said: "we really wanted to offer something new to consumers.
The trail is impressive, and at the same time is something to announce the benefits.
We finally did a lot of wild brain storm when it came to the idea of "let's seek Ian."
Interest in the health of mice has become a global phenomenon, the claim
I just wanted to put a much bigger context on products rather than talk about products; everyday we wanted to put in a much greater context of the importance of good and bad bacteria in our environment, the importance of mide health, and the immune system.
The interest on health care is becoming a global phenomenon, and with this documentary consumers will be able to provide more information in an interesting way in connection with this situation.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great understanding of humour!
Tom Hakin, who runs the film, added: "I have to tell you; Ian, like the disgusting Russian toilets shown in the movie, I would have lost my respect against him when he was denied some of the things he wanted. '
Naturally it was easy for Ian to lick some things, though some were quite difficult.
I am happy that we have made some of these dirty slang acts. '
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of respondents said they believed the bacteria were associated with the health of mice, and 58 percent said they also used products containing mercury, at least as intermittent.
Magnificently, the family destroyed the social residence of Saltillo, ahead of the evacuation
When a magician leaves his family, they are evacuated on the grounds that they are scared of damage to 50,000 pounds worth of social housing.
Tanya Skeldon and his wife were taken from their homes in Saltillo, Cornwall, after many complaints against them.
When they were forcibly removed from the property, housing association officials were baffled as to whether the property could be repaired.
The walls are available in large holes, planted to the option of wood, the locations are garbage, and the walls are written in graffiti.
The family has now been evacuated from their homes and are thought to have benefited from the option of private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, the manager of Cornwall housing, said she was afraid that even though the situation cannot be saved.
He himself said: 'this is really a nightmare for people here and I think people should not have to live in this way.
But there is a lot to be taken into account because this property will no longer be known as a much unpleasant part of Cornwall.
This family has had a misfortune and their names are in a bad fortune.
The family had three sons living in the intermediate property, and according to police, the family was involved in a fight with bats on the street, scare the nearby residents, drug use, drug sale and excessive shouting, discussion, and many scary behavior involving clusters.
In June, Skeldon (47), who had been named in the Kira contract, was given a conscience verdict.
Demolition of many rooms in the house, which is thought to have been found in the old trash
The sale of drugs in the past, the property was removed from the wood
Neighbours said they were fighting in the street, and the police were often looking for
Cornwall opted for the move, voluntarily extended for 11 weeks after it was revealed that it and his wife were evicted from the property this week.
The evacuation was greeted by relief neighbours who said they had returned to the nightmare of their lives.
One person said: 'I don't care.'
We've been living side by side with them for 20 years and the situation was always bad.
If we say how many times we saw the police here, you wouldn't believe it.
'This morning, we haven't been able to sleep. '
Partner woke up because it was very quiet; we were not accustomed to it!
Finally, now, everything will be great.
The Cornwall Council's neighbourhood sanction officer, Adam Werman, said the family did not co-operate with the local government.
Family, lived in this house for 20 years, and the country was often called police
Social homes were covered with plants on the side of garbage and old toys dumped
I added: 'the tenant does not take any responsibility for the release of himself and his family; it is really embarrassing; the evacuation has always been the option for Cornwall to finally apply.
The behaviour is extreme, and it's a very difficult time since the actions of the neighbours are frightening at the level of failure of the individual.
I highly appreciated the efforts of the members of the Community, Devon and Cornwall Police Forces and to give us information.
I hope that this development will provide some relief to the neighbours and to be understood as a message that will not tolerate antisocial behaviour.
Mr Fitzpatrick said that he had three sons living in the property at different times but their 20 years old.
The evacuation of the house in one of the bedrooms on the ground in a dirty bed
Homes of employees will need to clear a pile of garbage surrounding the house
In 2014, police stormed the property with over 70 pounds of marijuana, weigh, special items and 1,700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to Class B drug possession with intent to sell.
He claimed that he would use the money to buy a grave for his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After leaving the homeless, Tanya and his wife are now staying in a private residence on the left winger.
The walls of most of the rooms were found in graffiti.
Police said they will try to evict tenants who violate the rental rules
Devon and Cornwall Police Forces Angela Crow said the release was also a warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
He said to himself, 'This is a message that they can act as they want without any raw deal, and that their behaviour will be in vain. "
Devon and Cornwall Police will continue to work with its partners to protect society and will never tolerate crime and conscience behaviour.
Were flying from the military plane just through the beach in Portugal, where the tourists were appalled
Portugal, Aveiro in the sun, tourists have suffered the shock of their life
Portuguese air force P-3C Orioles flight from the very end of the plane
Air force, said it was training flights but did not insist that there was a risk of police
The pen was flying through the beach full of tourists while tourists started to panic about this.
Dramatic footage of the upcoming military aircraft approaching almost in contact with the sun on the sand in Aveiro in the north of Portugal.
Holidaymakers are coming out of the clouds to see what is coming towards them from the noise created by the jet engines in understandable concern over their feet.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.
One of the few who shared the video of the dramatic recent flight to social media, Daniel said: 'I really took the pen twice and appeared to be hit at one point.'
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and I felt like I was going to fall on my plane.'
Available on the beach in Aveiro, the tourists out in the darkness began to fly at very low altitudes
In Portugal, today P-3C Orion crashed on the coast of pilots to describe fishing boats in training flights, and the only way to control them is to go so far as to leave the pen.
The nearby extinguished force due to smoke coming from the fire was weak, the jet was flying more than usual, but the air force insisted that no one was safe in danger.
This summer, extinguished power fires have destroyed certain sections of the main land of Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
Portugal's air force said today the pilot should fly from the pen due to heavy smog and smoke) resulting from the difficult conditions (extinguished by force fires)
The plane was training flights and as a part of drawing pilots from fishing boats, it was asked to define the
The girl, who was the burger girl, was killed in Syria,
Last year, one of the three British girls who left for London to participate in the fund, Kadiza Sultana, was reportedly killed in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said his family had received information about his death in Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that he was thought to have died in a Russian air attack on the Rakyat area, where the group is strong in the country.
Sultana was 17 and died while he was planning to flee the country, which was damaged by the war, according to his family.
"we hope that this situation is really risky for others as a grave and testament to war zones, and we hope that people will have the courage to make this choice," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, two girls from Sultana and eastern London boarded a plane to Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana was married to his family in Syria, where he was married to a fighter, and had been a widow for several months.
Reid indicated that she would not give up Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court if she was elected
Harry Reid, the leader of the senate, has said he believes he will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
The senate was blocking the process of ratification by Garland since President Obama nominated him in March.
The senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said former Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia would choose the new speaker to replace the person.
Reid said in a video Thursday that he believes Clinton will choose Garland and that "there are reasons for that."
Later, a spokesman for Reid, speaking on behalf of Reid, said he had not spoken with Clinton directly about whether he would nominate Garland and that there was speculation.
He praised Garland himself and said that Clinton's team did not want to "spoil the current situation" by making a new choice.
Garland is the presiding judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Regardless of who is blocking the nomination, Reid testified that the Republican vice presidential nominee, Donald Trump, is "helping" and "paedophiles."
Trump has indicated that he is not suitable for the task.
Treat for women as much as it is for women in favour of a naked calendar, he said,
Treats magazine has been working with photographer David Bellemere to publish a timetable designed to be inspired by the Pirelli of the 1970s for the year 2017.
But instead of famous and naked people, they are trying to find a new generation of ball models for the 2017 NU Ilham Permit calendar.
Steve Jobs, chief executive of Treats, said earlier this year that the high rate of license plates was different from that of the former banks of the magazine, because "somewhat of the money is for men."
I do this for women.
Certain that the schedule believes that is the case.
"men, like the men in the press release on the calendar, should be able to look at this footage of women in the female body as well, so as not to go out of fashion, we must return to the classic plates of fashion," he said in a press release on the calendar.
Women, it is a beautiful piece of art to seek to be a part of this project.
Models may send photos online or at open talks in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl target: are they actually the ones who buy?
Middle aged, lonely men with cranes.
Besides the secrets of our partner, we uncovered amazing insults under our rap section before heading to the comment section to let us say this is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, much of the aforementioned issue is the return of the license plates created by a physical object in cash, not The generation of innovation cash, but a result of the middle age nostalgia.
Until recently, vinyl albums were mostly between the ages of 45 and 54.
Actually, the age group of 18 to 24 is the lowest possibility.
This is also not merely an act of saving the enthusiasts; it is also an emotional importance; older vinyl buyers usually love to hide their feelings (56% and 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% and 66%) of people.
So what are the results of YouGov?
If this blog were to be aired on television, I would say that if the camera was on a crowded street, with a modest gray number of hands, while crossing the street with a modest gray suit and waving my hands, they were watching something authoritarian like: "then let's take a look."
But then, let's take an eye.
Soon the center of Soho is slowly picking up and the unusual mood (once independent sellers of buildings are now filled with hotels, Eats, PRETS and Paperback) is still available in a few specialised garages.
I would probably have to stop from the camera for the next number; I would try to learn about my aged and emotional condition through observation by standing near the different men in some of these stores.
Sister Ray (from the data counting: two young women, three middle-aged men) Reckless record (data counting: eight middle-aged men, probably 20 years old, followed by a woman) while I was in London in the afternoon for a meeting, and taking a look at the stores to fill the empty few hours.
Asked whether he was a collector.
"then I think," he says.
About 3000 or 4000 degrees.
The official listed above (the official sent me the email, with no follow up to the house itself) to decorate the walls of the residence.
With so many albums and sets, the reason for the total can be spent, partly as a result of revenue; it can no longer afford to run out of money, and can buy back when they sell in times of young and pennies.
"most of the things I said at the beginning of the 60 â² s were at the beginning of the 70's, when I was 11 or 12; I was very young to get things done," he says.
Those who like to stay alone in the purchase of the garages are likely to be looking for people who are interested in the idea and adds: "if I smoke, I get a lot of alcohol.
Poor adherence to this.
Sister Ray, who works in Wez (25), thinks most of his clients have complied with the YouGov profile.
But he also noticed that a new wave of youngsters, affected by exaggerated advertising in the media, needs to buy back the old record of those who had come back in this fashion.
During my discussions, I normally received an overhaul of the collections of people in 1998 or 1999.
They originally sold their vinyl for the purchase of the CD and now sells the CD to get back to the tracks, "he says.
This could explain the increase of certain underage persons who have cranes.
Or the alleged emotional significance of the plates?
The price of a store is similar to the one in the store, similar to the personality of people who offer a community of relief that takes you a few seconds to notice.
Still, according to some of the older customers, the payment system, especially without contacts.
While some vinyl enthusiasts may be seeking refuge in the stability of the familiar plygates, reminiscent of the digital world and the recalcitrant youth memories.
Wez says; "sometimes the reason for this is to fill a gap or to see the material items as a kind of comfort."
I am also a collector myself, and I think this is also the personality of most of the people.
It's an easy way to fill your head.
When a colleague jumped from a pile of crap, he says, "Social service workers are like that."
In April, a poll revealed that 50% of the vinyl album areas had not yet been listening to the album.
The survey also found that 41% had no use at all, and 7 per cent bought vinyl, even though it was not stolen.
Looking at this stage of the news, I was probably very anxious to see a series of bossa nova feed.
One aspect of this return is the "reward" aspect of Sounds in Universum (data counting: three middle-aged man) working at Jonny (42), which is a factor.
"he soon came to me and said:" I don't have my record but I want to get a Radiohead record to put it on our shelves. "
This represents a great swim, though it certainly reflects the current situation.
More products, less music.
There are people who say: "I don't have my record."
These young people, not the elderly, are at the end of their age, which is the new entry into this issue.
Until now, there have been almost all times for vinyl, which is quite volatile when I see the kits.
More than 70 years old, couples, tourists, young boys and middle-aged women.
It is good to see diversity among customers, though the atmosphere above mentioned stores (the last part of the Wild Bus) is less Holding-friendly than jazz instead of calming jazz.
None of them seem particularly lonely but it is hard to find solutions to the psychological trauma that disturbed them by stopping for longer than 30 seconds.
Elanora (27), a few minutes, is on tour in Fopp and is taking a look at the tracks in the downloading.
Spend it only to look at the window instead.
He says he has no choice but to record the collection.
Very costly.
Whether it is easier to listen to music or listen to music in other ways, but the beauty of the vinegar... like one in the seventies, away from the interior.
I don't know how to explain, really like the other.
The last stop is said to have inspired a new generation of cranes with a passion for the store: for example, a store.
Dressed as they were looking at them, I observed a group of young daughters gathered around Polaroid cameras for a while before the debate on the purchase of a crocodile and her daughter.
The left Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood are in a hurry, filled with the plug gap; there is a must for an average collection of tracks; a mix of modern and classic.
No one is looking at them; perhaps they are just marvelous, as some are intact too high.
This is a purely "artistic vinyl."
But the wonder for these items, however, could mean that the industry has more money and less customers will be sent into the depths of Soho; there are no more issues that can complain.
With more money and time, it is not surprising that a demographic group is spending more money on more luxurious items, such as vinyl.
But the findings, however, show that YouGov's results are accurate, at least in Soho stores; the number, which is more than the number, is in reality, in stores or online forums, in which women collector and cranes do not take into account their passion.
Some people are working hard, possibly at school or in offices.
Some people certainly do not spend their evening on a tour of the Berwick street in Berwick, surrounded by a fake television server, where they look at the record and look through the shoulders of middle-aged men who are not in anything.

French court rejected the offer of the demolition of shops at Manga refugee camp
A court in France rejected the offer by Calais officials for the demolition of dozens of makeshift stores and restaurants in Manga, where thousands of refugees live.
During a court hearing this week, Calais officials argued that the state had sold many products from cigarettes to people inside the camp -- the equivalent of 50 cents (40p) for tea, or 50 cents (40p), for a total of 72 makeshift stores sold for basic food.
Calais governors have argued that this is where they should be knocked down because they create an unpaid parallel economy and they are at risk of fire and hygiene.
Assistance to groups, court stores and restaurants is vital, the free food offered by state government agencies and other groups is not enough for the growing population in the camp.
Many shops and restaurants have argued that they often provided shelter and free food to the owners.
A court in the city, which operates 72 makeshift stores, said it is not a legal anchor for deportation of persons, but the concerns of Calais governors are "completely understandable."
The judge, Jean-Francois Molla, said groceries, cafes and restaurants had a much bigger role than just feed people living in "very dangerous conditions."
These areas provided comfortable meeting points for refugees and volunteers, he said.
The book, which is one of the places that is in danger of being torn down, offers a book for children with non-profit, offers 200 meals each day, provides English and French lessons, and here are recommendations on asylum to refugees, hundreds of minors in the camp.
Over 150,000 people signed the petition to protect this head, which is for children.
In a letter to the Guardian, he said this closure would be "a disaster for these children, some of whom are more than eight years old."
The two charity institutions, Serbians and L'Auberge des Festivals, estimated Friday that the number of people in the Manga camp, after growing at the peak of the summer, rose by 9,000 (the highest number so far).
Fiji, after gold in the class, was simply a silver medal at the championship of rugby
The dramatic advance of the Great Britain Rugby 7 championship ended after a 43-7 defeat at the Rio Deodoro Stadium on Thursday.
Fiji is the first Olympic medal in each of the colours to get the gold, but, bypassing, side by side, support, lines and illness on the ground.
After the defeat, Great Britain received the third silver medal of the day as a consolation prize, and New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa were no longer proud of their efforts in the Olympic 7 opening tournament, which they defeated.
At the beginning of the day, they could have found them in the final after the South African Team defeated 7-5 in the semifinal.
But still, in such format, it could even beat a team of 15.
If not very sickness maybe Great Britain will wear a gold medal tomorrow at least as soon as the console ends: Fiji's top coach, Ben Ryan, is a British from Wimbledon.
This is quite a difficult journey for Great Britain.
Eight years ago, when they worked with Ryan at Adelaide, they lost every match at the Championship.
This time around, I've only lost one.
But the progress shown in this defeat is really a shock.
Fiji has made a fascinating start, with the players, Great Britain, through their attempts to get the ball.
This blasted Tom Mitchell and his team for what it was like to run between a series of mobile bus and World Servicing champions, the action that took place in the corner of Obuispo 5-0.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai left the buffalo with another number on his face.
The game was 12-0 and Great Britain almost failed to touch the ball.
Mitchell's wonderful intervention prevented Sierra Leone Nakarawa from taking the lead in the third, but that was only to delay the number of Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored the right corner, and Great Britain fell back 17-0.
With just one minute left to the end of the first half, Nakarawa made a number more from scratch.
As Vatemo Ravouvou later flew to the line for the number, through some difficult Great Britain intervention.
Between that number, and the scoreboard was 29-0.
Fiji is a team that was established to play in the 7th championship, while Great Britain was yet trying to learn the foundations of the job.
The situation is more or less the case.
The Great Recession made major changes and closed the Fiji threshold; for the full four minutes that was a good introduction to the first half, which was a good introduction to Josua Tuisova until he performed with the perfect Fiji game.
Dan networked for Great Britain, and made a try to make the score 36-7 to make it to the left corner of the game, but the game fans sing, waving the flag and dancing in the hands of the South Sea Adventure.
Fiji's cheerful approach from the beginning was really difficult to avoid.
Sanctuary Viliatame, which does not need to be decorated in the final minutes of play, is also in the final draw.
When the whistle was stolen, the Fijillers began the celebration, and Great Britain ended up in the way of a defeat.
At the beginning of the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semifinal, a tough semi-final match in Great Britain, facing South Africa; Britain scored a single.
Kyle Brown suggested the South African team in the first half, but Dan netted the top leg movements with the second half with the numbers.
Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, who took part in the top 15 of England, secured the victory and also secured a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, the coach, inspired the fight against cancer by means of victory on the podium
There won't be any more emotional gold medals in these games, and that's a significant meaning.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, who suffered 220 lashes after the first straw, noticed that they could be much more meaningful than they were when they were stressed in the Estacio de Lagoa.
Although there were two men on each podium, there were three voices in the boat; women in the double race were the first women to reach such a level in the UK this year as the first women to advance to the second gold Olympic medal in the process were the voice of their coach, Robin Williams.
The judges were pretty clear; this was their unprecedented, undefeated series of 39th races.
Since we see two wonderful athletes who sticks at the surface of the ice, this does not fully reflect the nature of the victory.
Looking behind each rowing gold medal, there was a battalion of keen hands that made this difference, and without any hands, 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, he could see this on the day he was not as effective as the coach.
Touching, and, as he was saying.
I was caught up in the types of cancer that can interfere with the surgery, and made it.
If they do, it goes everywhere.
This would have been quite a bad situation.
Nevertheless, this is changing your look a bit.
Williams to be identified in December 2013.
With the exception of the season itself, he was very fortunate to be able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, so it is not known whether he would be an accurate expression in such cases but this way he will be able to minimise the attention crunch.
I was supposed to get payment for this reason I quickly improved my laser.
This was an encouragement for me.
I was able to get to the hospital and say it was enough to take a few steps but the garden was 6, 9, 15 metres in the heart.
Started in this way.
Throwing a ride on its own, but this is followed by a little more markings.
After the victory, he was speaking a bit more than ever to overcome his own concerns when he was in Williams, who spent a tense morning.
Stanning, who is the captain of the royal guard, and who had previously gone to Afghanistan, said, "I was emotionally destroyed this week, maybe this is a bit extreme but from the point of view it is too big."
I mean, this is what it means for me and Helen, me and the bin, once the stresses of how many are working.
Helen and I spent a wonderful three years with the bin.
If we were in the bin we must therefore be the best coach in the world because I want to convey my greatest thanks to him.
I wouldn't be able to find a better person or better coaches for work.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the race for five years.
They have reached a difficult rhythm that can't be reached by their competitors.
Even Stanning and Glover's strength had not yet been exhausted by the closing of New Zealand and the Danish teams.
Ourselves that we have lost the main.
Helen in the process, in our address.
Doors and not going to be really important.
We have done a good start, and we don't try to do anything incredible.
We did not expect the explosion of fireworks today, we just want to win the race, which is good rowing, which we did in it.
They will give a two-year break before deciding what to do in the future.
Glover's wedding is supposed to be attended next month; he and his television adventurer Steve Backus have been confirmed.
For the time being, she just wants to enjoy this.
I do not want to say that this is my last race.
This would create too much pressure.
I noticed that I am an Olympic champion in London for six months.
This was a lot of beat and I was very stress.
Here, this lasted for about four minutes.
This is a much better feeling, "he said.

Bulgaria Announces First Definition Rate for 8 months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation in Bulgaria in June was 1%.
This is the highest value seen over the years (since June 2012) but it is the first value seen on sub-zero since October, following a 0.2% decline in positive last year.
The average annual inflation measured for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was 0.8%, compared with the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared with June 2016, meaning the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the rate of inflation (between July 2016 and December 2015) difference - was 0.2% and the monthly inflation gap between July 2016 and July 2015 - 0.2%.
Compared with the previous month in July 2016, the price increase observed in consumer product groups was observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), entertainment and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), informants and services (0.3%).
Clothing and shoes (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%) and health (0.1%) fell in groups.
Alcoholic beverages and tobacco have remained at the same level as prices in housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; telecommunications and educational groups.
Bottom line: my "Anime" effects were described as Asian cartoons
Bottom line is for this filter to be inspired by the memory of the memory, but some observers have said that it is racial.
Bottom line, the tool with around 150 million users every day is changing the authenticity of users to play with their absurdities.
Whenever you feel a memory, you can turn the dog or a Roy Lichtenstein painting into a character.
Makers, with over 30 million improved summary filming each day, are reckless, feature changing vehicles.
Wrong steps, quickly digging into the memory of the public.
Snapline makers face charges that they have supported black classifieds in the past, or presented their declarations as beauty ideals.
It is for this reason that some critics have criticised the company for adopting a "Asian guise" because of the lens and the lens that makes users suffer, due to the lens and the lens that makes the bottles stand out.
And I wonder whether these repeat conflicts have pointed to a bigger problem with the diversity of the company.
The news and outrage spread with reports of The Verge and Motherboards on Wednesday, and a day after it was announced that Snapline had been removed.
The company said in a statement: the assailants were not to be caricaturised, but the anime characters were prepared.
But for observers who experience racism, however, these are reminded of the pain of suffering.
Other people generally rejected the comparison to the anime.
Speaking to an American art student of Korean origin and shared his tweets about the photos, Sparapani said that in an e-mail he was "bitter and uncomfortable on the lighter note."
He added that it is difficult to debate when it comes to comparing the side effects of syphilis with bad Asian cartoons.
This shows that the filter is not only an Asian guise, but also a humiliating level of Asian guise.
Bottom line is not the only company that has the cultural trigger mechanisms.
The culture of the meeting of institutions, institutions of Hollywood, and the equipment that we all possess is in many areas of diversity and typically in an endless conflict.
And the bottom line is that the diversity of racial diversity is more than that of other opponents of the broader young mass, which may have been interpreted as a higher sensitivity.
In an interview on Thursday, Katie Zhu, 25, one of the makers of Snapline, said that when asked to create a small lowering for a user, "it is much more difficult for such movements to be noticed as before."
On Thursday, Mrs Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for the Medium, decided to delete the account of Snapline and call everyone in that direction.
Medium wrote for the article and said in an interview on the phone that he believes that the conflict related to race is reflected in the shortcomings regarding the diversity in recruitment practices.
Mrs Zhu, the leader of the majority of white men in the company, criticised the article by saying that his team was terminated with a label: # Snapex.
"there are different ethnicities among staff or staff who are not able to make such decisions or are working there and people from different ethnicities do not feel safe or comfortable enough to speak to themselves," said Mrs Zhu, an American of China origin.
Other observers say that Snapline is largely left without answering his views on this complaint.
The company does not share figures regarding the diversity among its staff, stressing the state of the private company.
Also on Thursday, Snapline staff declined to share their racial origin but according to a spokesperson, the company was not recently adequately represented to focus on the population and to include a recruitment responsible for the work to improve internally.
Mrs Zhu said that in her own terms, Snapline would keep the account closed, and added, "I wonder if it is true that more users like us will be able to say that this is not true."
Congressional Panel, military officials, were of the opinion that the destruction of
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel reported that the United States Attorney General Command had falsified intelligence reports to a more optimistic picture of the events on the ground that led to the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
A recent report by a working arm of the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense allowances subcommittee has identified a "widespread dissatisfaction" among intelligence analysts who say their superiors have changed their assessment of the Islamic State of America.
Centre Command, known as CENTCOM, is a military headquarters located in Tampa, Fla., and oversees the operations of the American military in the Middle East and Central Asia.
In a news release on the report, the report said: "the intelligence results approved by senior Centcom leaders are much more positive than the analysis of the facts on the ground that are typical of US terrorism prevention efforts, and consistently offers much more positive results from the analysis of other elements of the intelligence community."
"the ones in Centcom are unacceptable; poor analysis has been presented to senior decision makers while our warriors are suffering," California Republican Representative Ken Calvert said.
CENTCOM leadership failures have reached the highest levels of the company.
The 10 page report, the Centre Command statement that the work of training Iraqi forces in training and analysis is involved in the details of the permanent problems in 2014 and 2015.
Regardless of how, senior Obama administration officials have ordered the replacement of the reports, though not the exact evidence that the analysts were in, and also known as DADT, to offer a more optimistic view of the threat created by the Centcom leaders to feel the pressure.
"in the first half of 2015, several central Komut press bulletins, declarations and congressional statements are significantly more inaccessible than actual events," the report said.
; for example, a Centcom official said a major military attack for the back of Mosul could be held as early as April or May 2015, an official said.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in control of the Islamic state.
Mike Pompeo, the Republican Representative for Cancer, said in a statement, "After months of research, this clarification has been fairly clear."
Throughout the middle of 2014, until the middle of 2015, the most senior intelligence leaders of the central command of the United States are in Iraq, where the threat posed by the military is irrelevant as the commander has manipulated the intelligence results.
The analysts have expressed concern that the manipulation of intelligence on the Islamic state has created a working arm after learning.
Overall the report, published on Thursday, will follow much more comprehensive findings.
The Ministry of Defence is also present to examine another Centcom intelligence, which is being conducted by the inspector general.
House Intelligence Committee Democrat members also attended some of the conclusions of the Republican working arm on Thursday to publish their own findings.
Democratic Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's Democratic chairman, said in a declaration that "between 2014 and 2015, Centcom, DADT, and the Iraqi Security Forces have been very narrow in their intelligence assessment."
According to Mr. Schiff, this process "delayed the publication of intelligence results," causing a moral disorder among analysts, and "did not adequately include opposing opinions."
However, Mr. Schiff and the Democrats have said that they have not reached a finding that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to "advance or tell a political explaining" the results.
Preliminary results of the review of the Congress have been announced by the Daily Bachelor on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that a Pentagon inspector general review was available following complaints by Centcom analysts.
Senior Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said the inspector general was continuing to examine the inspector general in the process that the defense ministry would not comment on the congressional report.
However, he said, "experts say that in some cases they can dispute the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence support healthy dialogue in connection with these important national security considerations."
The research shows that Iraq and Syria will deal with the problem beyond whether the bombing operation of its predecessors in America is continuing (this is an argument made by more defense officials every day).
But the accusations last year reveal the question of how Obama can count on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations at Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Despite the criticism of Islamic State intelligence, Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote an article in which he defended the administration of a small force in Iraq, despite opposition from many analysts in the George W. Bush administration, and said he did not think enough of the 2003 invasion in which he started and debated for more than a decade.
Mr Hooker, at the same time, is playing a significant role in Islamic state intelligence on the one hand.
The authorities have concluded that Mr. Hooker's team has built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market in spite of public statements to the contrary last year and has concluded that the terrorist group did not substantially affect the financial resources of the terrorist group.
The Times in September, however, found that this finding did not come out of the Command.
CENTCOM was then in the sand when General Lloyd J. Austin III, last year, put many laws in his statement in the Senate as a very positive assessment of the war, apparently for criticism.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by the central command of the person General Joseph L. Vhotel.
Prepared to match with a US Women's Hockey Team Arrock 4, winning the victory
Katie Bam scored three goals in the 6-1 win against Japan on Thursday, a day after the Americans beat India 3-0 in the first two goals of the United States women grass hockey team.
The five goals in the two matches seem to require a catchy illness of Bam (27), who said he was not sure whether they had done the same before.
He said to himself, "I have no idea."
I'm not the people who record the score.
He knows: Americans are 4-0 ahead of the Olympic tournament and beat Japan on Thursday after losing 2-0 in the first place in the group with an unbeaten path.
And the United States will face for the final game of the first round on Saturday.
In both teams are entitled to the quarterfinals and the match will determine who will finish second in the group's matches with six teams.
After the first finish of the group matches, the team will face a slightly longer period of time with the strong Dutch team, the leader of another group that starts the quarter finals.
After Saturday's game, however, Americans made surprising progress here after the London Olympics, where they won the last of the 12 teams.
BAC was on this team.
He himself grew up in Blue Bell, Pa.; when he first received the hockey stick when he was 3 years old (the twins were interested in this sport) and joined the national team at the age of 16, he became the youngest player in the team.
Last staff for failing to qualify for the 2008 Olympics.
Later he and his teammates did not go towards most of the things for 2012.
The next year, a British coaches Craig Parnham took the oath of office and things began to change.
BAC, "a cultural change, a mental change, a physical change," says
We don't work like in London anymore.
I have passed the transformation completely.
Thursday night, Bam, closely at odds with a hit, received the first number of the first half.
India was not yet a win in the tournament but the team had a surprising level of endurance in the lead up to the third quarter, where Bam managed to maintain a 1-0 lead.
He took a long time with the ball from the left of the field and later said he took the ball shots and put the Americans 2-0.
Melissa Gonzales scored the final goal towards the middle of the fourth quarter.
This was one of the first three victories that allowed the United States goalkeeper, Briggs, to score a goal in the tournament, not the first.
Chance opens.
BAC, too.
Parnham said "we are in a good place at the moment," but that depends on how well the site is at the conclusion of Saturday's match.
Olympic ambitions in the village of Tramboli
Where you would be, no matter how many hours, the Olympics continue.
Events in Rio de Janeiro represent a mixture of ambitions, competition and work, and it will never end, like it or not.
The Olympic torch relay itself is like a flare-up, where the gymnasts were then referred to the trio.
Simone Biles, Katie Leguansky, or Michael Phelps and his name, Le Clos, cannot follow the television without a thing about strife, cannot read the newspaper or listen to what your neighbor says in a cafe.
And Logan Dooley, too.
For the first time, Mr. Dooley, who has been participating in the Olympics for the first time, sponsors and makes you feel good about watching TV advertisements like a swimmer, gymnast or fencer, who can turn a blind eye to one of the islands shown in the prime time.
But from Lake of California, Mr. Dooley (28) is fighting for a gold medal at the Olympics.
The Olympic alhouse doesn't have an equal level of light at every event.
Also, in part, away from the centre, there are no universally recognizable sports: air rifle waste, archery, badminton, etc.
Breastfeeding will always be with us, with the wish to be in a long time.
I would also like to draw attention to the hidden magic of the tramadol, if it is my personal best.
Although it has been known as an Olympic event since 2000, when both tramadol was promoting Sydney games, very few people were asked in the 16 years to realise that it was an Olympic sport.
This could be a regional ignorance.
The United States is sending athletes for the competition, but there has never been a medal in the tramadol and a rising contestant to the finals by 2012.
Men awards for the Chinese and Russians, while women share the Chinese and Canadians.
China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie MacLennan will try to preserve their gold medals in London this year.
It is worth noting, however, that the tramadol is an event; part of the reason for this is partly due to the fact that unconsciousness towers may be considered to be awarded to the palliative care school instead of the Olympics.
I admit that I am not the expert here, I just have the issue.
The funny thing is that there is a potential (never the end) of the jump created by the cartoon like the other, but basically the two sports that brought together gymnastics and dwarfs.
The word "Trams" comes from the Spanish hand tramadol; this is the meaning of the word "tramps."
The champion candidates are presided over by a large tramadol almost from the air, taking 30 precautions and putting them at their feet, before a series of moves (scholarships, pike and Salto) to do.
According to the official Olympic programme, the executive has difficulty and is evaluated according to "flight limits."
In Rio, 16 men from 17 countries will compete for thirty-two athletes, including 16 women.
The Olympics are the direct advanced in progress.
Those who hoped to receive the medal, in some cases in search of gold, until the point of the end, in some cases farther back, with more or less movements, should come out faster and more or less.
Not only are they not pursuing the finish wall either, at the same time, there is another formidable line of publication on television; the world or an Olympic record.
The effort is noble, envy and even extreme levels; it is enough to bring tears to even one viewers.
However, this is the feature I find lightly exhausting while in full Games.
Drying, you can give a break to all of them.
Tilt the edges of the movement to the left or right.
Goals is not to move forward.
Upper right picks up, like the astronaut, does not appear to be more or less interest, down, and more or less interest in the text.
Of course, there is no competition or difficulty, but in order to reach the conclusion of the duration of the routine, there is no lost work, away from work, just like the imagination of the time and place of the suspension of the oval.
Holding an Olympic race is so much more than if he can be.
The women's rankings and then finals will be held at 13.00 on Friday afternoon in the eastern savior; men again on Saturday at 13.
NBC will publish the finals on both days, starting at 14.00 in the afternoon.
In the middle of the Olympic madness, they can ignore the general melee in a quiet and wonderful moment.
And the awareness, according to The Wall Street Journal of the United States male gymnastics, as recently proposed, only sticks to eye sticks and objects by offering male athletes if it is up to the athlete to say that Mr. Dooley expects new fans.
Ally of Ethiopia, for a long time, "a Generation of Protestants
Protesters inside the violence in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia, faced with severe resistance from the government.
Numerous protesters say they have received deadly weapons coups in a shootout with police.
Ethiopia to collapse?
Over the last decade, Africa has been a solid ally for the West, with one of the most stable nations and the fast growing economy.
In recent months, however, anti-government protests have rocked the country by spreading to more regions every day.
Last week alone, thousands of people in the street called for fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response was quite merciless.
Masterpieces, police officers hit and killed several unarmed demonstrators.
The protest footage, thought to be from late last year or early this year, was seen by security officials who had broken their hands against a wall and forced young people to stand up.
The highest level United Nations human rights official now wants a thorough review.
"it has always been difficult to keep this country together, and it will be much more difficult to move forward," says Obdi Abdi, project director of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia, after Nigeria, is one of the highest in the population of the nation and is appreciated by the stability of the West.
The American military and intelligence services have been working closely with the Nigerians to combat terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and there are very few countries that have been helped by the West in Africa.
Ethiopia's economy has grown in an impressive way.
The infrastructure has been effectively improved; there is even a new commuter train in Addis Ababa, the capital.
And the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Whatever the best example of democracy in Ethiopia is not displayed (although human rights groups have repeatedly referred to the repressive attitude of the government) within the country, the opposition was quite limited, effectively silencing the opponents.
Many were sent into exile, imprisoned, killed or driven to the most distant corners of the earth.
However, that may be about to change.
Seyoum Tesler, a university professor from Central Ethiopia, said, "If you have drowned people and offer them no other choice than to protest, these events are of interest."
Youth completely in protest.
A generation of protest.
Many complaints are under pressure from the ruling coalition over the use of land.
After last year's pretty criticism of the election, the ruling party and its allies also took the last post of filling out opponents, and now control 100 per cent of the parliament.
At the same time, tensions in the border with Eritrea, which led to the war that killed several hundred people in June, are also on the rise.
Analysts fear that separatist groups, such as the Oromo Freedom Front or Ogaden National Freedom Front, have disappeared in recent years, citing the proliferation of this species.
The bitter feeling that has been boiled under the surface for years is the reason why there are a few factors that are now exploding.
The winner seems innocent: smart phones.
Cheap smart phones are spreading and internet service has started to communicate using a large number of Ethiopian social media only a few years ago.
The government, especially in times of protest, often shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, even when most people were able to communicate through internet caretaker servers that hide their positions.
A few young Ethiopian said they had gathered in this way for the protests.
In the second, the solidarity between the two major ethnic groups of Ethiopia, Oromney and Amhariah, has also increased.
Meals and Amrons are not normally allied.
For too long, Ethiopia has been the dominant Christian in the mountainous regions of Amhariah policy and businesses, most of which were Muslim, and in plain land, the Oromite was not abused.
However, that is changing.
"we are moving toward co-operation to gather under one umbrella," said Multi Gemechu, an Oromo leader.
The biggest protests were seen in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Apart from that, most Amhara and Oromo, Ethiopia, account for about 6 percent of the population, and the military, intelligence services, trade and policy dominated the Tigrera ethnic group, which is not fair by members of the ethnic group.
The third reason behind the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebellion leader, served as prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
Seeing everyone, who was considered a tactical genius.
Nevertheless, he is an expert on his ability to identify the first signs of unrest and ineffectiveness to his opponents.
"the current regime does not have this basic knowledge," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, HAILESMARIAM Desalega, has been chosen in limbo to fill the place of Mr. Meles.
In contrast to Mr. Meles from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. HAILEMARIAM is south.
Nevertheless, he says, he has failed to gain the confidence of security services controlled by Tigrayans.
More as a result, with more fear of blood.
Ethiopia's latest experience on such a turmoil was the protest following the theft of thousands of people in 2005, after analysts said the government had a choice from the beginning.
The measures that followed, both less than last month, were killed and many protesters were killed, and the period of turmoil was also relative faster.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for remarkable progress in infrastructure planning and the fight against poverty, such as the new commuter train.
However, it is clear that it does not stop the increased tide against the government of Ethiopia.
And this is dangerous and ethnic.
Last month, protesters in the town of Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and Tigrera hatred increased in social media.
Analysts say the protests are leaving a strange situation in the United States and other allies in the West.
The United States government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights on neighbouring Somalia; however, it has recently been told that the base has been closed.
The West clearly wants to promote democracy in a fragile region that does not want this ally to fall apart.
Mr Abdi said this "and added," I like to walk on a very fine and
Donald Trump Announces "Allegations" of Obama, in which he was
Donald J. Trump, on Friday, insisted a few times last week that Obama and Hillary Clinton were not serious while claiming that the Islamic State terrorist group "founders" tried to eliminate the recent conflict around the campaign.
This statement gave birth to new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate openly with the American public.
At the same time, it is best to defend it in the process that created chaos as well as to imply that this is not what the deputies are trying to explain in a strange position in the process.
Mr Trump proposed this at a rally Wednesday night after further strengthening his thesis on Thursday in interviews with the president and Mrs Clinton, who insisted that the drivers were really implied.
But in his sending via Twitter in the early hours of the morning on Friday, Mr. Trump said he had only cynical testimony.
Sending in a series of interviews, Mr. Trump said he was serious about this charge a day before he was completely back on the show.
Conservative radio programmer Hugh Hewitt said Mr. Obama wanted to destroy the drivers, reminding him that Mr. Trump tried to help him soften this comment when he said he did not believe it was the Republican presidential candidate.
Mr Trump has come to the final confusion when trying to change the focus of his campaign after a drop in the polls.
Mr Trump and Mrs Clinton clashed with each other on the economy in Michigan this week.
Friday, Mr. Trump has asked him to return to this issue again.
Once again, via Twitter, Mrs Clinton's offer would increase taxes, and he found himself boring in his speech.
Mr. Trump had previously used the defense.
At the end of July, after the Russians faced major criticism after taking a look at Mrs Clinton's e-mails offering a hacker attack, she said, "Of course I am cynical about it.
This approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and take a step back in the required place.
Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who follows the language used by both candidates, said that "this is an order that provides a way to explain how specific messages are treated by supporters themselves, depending on the reaction to the test."
At the same time, however, knowing these declarations, and from different makers, it is unclear as to who will filter out.
After a fall in the polls recently, Mr. Trump has taken a much more aggressive stance than to soften the air for the general election audience.
A new NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist survey released on Friday showed that Mr. Trump was quite behind Mrs Clinton in Northern Coraline, Virginia and Colorado, and a tight race exists in Florida.
Whatever Mr. Trump usually does, he has to apologize for the provocative things he has done, but he does not understand the words or humor of those who criticise him.
But Mr. Trump's joke, which has exposed much more scrutiny in the final months of the presidential campaign, leaves the remaining loyal supporters struggling to support it in public if his comments are provocative.
Former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is doing his best to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN Thursday as one of Mr. Trump's most suggested supporters.
When asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's thesis that Mr. Obama and Mrs Clinton set up an Islamic State, Mr. Giuliani said, "I think it's a legitimate, political criticism.
From one point of view, before Obama was an unknown, small company, those who find love for them were completely mistakes, and this was due to the withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Aside from the fact that most Republican, Mrs Clinton's foreign ministry has failed to cope with the situation in the Middle East, the Obama administration has failed to aggressively deal with the situation in the Middle East and is trying to defend what was caused by the growth of the drivers.
Ahead of the rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump is blaming each word on the news media via Twitter and continues to accuse him of being biased against it.
Trying to solve him, he made a mockery of the television specialists, who "cannot do this!"
With some Democrats ridiculed by Mr. Trump, he said it was evidence that he was not eligible for the presidency.
Those who are not on top with the prices are at the top of the mountain with us for
Vicksburg is just a part of the old shabby working with cash, which did not offer Wi-Fi connections for over 15 years, offering great coffee.
Naturally, the prices at the stores at Bedford Avenue.
The store, which replaces Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of Soap Cherie containers.
Of the inhabitants of the region, it was the last loss of the city, he said.
The artist Molly Crabuser wrote to Twitter: "new change, I know it but I still believe CBGB is heading and the Chelsea Hotel has been evacuated and the Verb is no longer a soap store."
New change as much as it is to the city of the invention.
Last November at Greenpeace, less than a mile away from its original position, a renovated Verb Cafe opened in the north.
The new Verb Cafe has Wi-Fi connections and acknowledges the credit card but protects some of its former employees and similar simple mood.
Coffee is still good.
At the beginning of the new Version, the former head of the long-term employee also owns the new site and the general manager, Cisco Rodriguez.
He joined the Verb in 2001 and up until the end.
When a customer offered him financing for this new place, he would be excited to do so.
Mr. Rodriguez (36), left most of the same.
The VERB uses the same distributor for the figures, and a Espresso machine from the same model.
And even the old Verb's lights were used again here.
Mr. Rodriguez, however, said he wanted to present a bit of different experience.
Added new materials.
Pastel-eggs-and-cheese sandwich bags are available on the menu, and materials such as onions and onions are available on the menu.
Shake the rice tape.
The cafe is no longer the beer service but offers fresh fruit juices.
Nine months later, Mr. Rodriguez said he noticed that the former patrons had begun to arrive decisively.
"many of our former clients are not at the top of prices in Vicksburg," he said.
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of these clients.
Mrs Oliveira (34) lives in Williamsburg, Va., and is a frequent departure to Verb.
But even after moving to Greenpeace, he did not give up on this path.
VERB closed the door to drink coffee for a while.
"I noticed that my favorite thing was coffee and culture in Verb," he said.
I started the coffee again now but instead of the regular ice coffee last day, I chose a new addition to the fence, which was added to the mix.
Tom Rosenthal, another patrons, has gone to Verb regularly, starting in 2003.
Expenditure there before and always have the same order.
"every day, in the seventh best quarter, I would never get to the vet, and I was preparing my marching orders for each of them," he said.
Mr. Rodriguez wants to make changes and add new materials to the menu.
Nowadays, Mr. Rosenthal still receives the usual orders, though sometimes every day the figures of bacon, eggs and cheese make some changes.
Mr Rodriguez said there was no fire in the soap store, which was replaced by the old site.
Conversely, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb using the coffee, which the head was cold.
"I think we can still accept this offer," said Mr. Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of the village at the foot of this head.
One of the new clients has been translated into dialects, and Mr. Rodriguez said that his new neighbours will soon find a space for this menu to feel good.
Other advantages of the new position.
Local juice store, cold say breakfast bottles and wants to sell it.
Over the head and the possibility of expanding the building.
Most clients can find their old favourites for a new Version, even if it is sufficient.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and was very sorry after the venue was closed.
When the new venue opened, Mr. Whitt was able to get coffee and make him feel at home.
"I was supposed to smell it," he said.
At the time of the crisis, the book "A, Meal
In March 1933, just after the Presidential Inauguration, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, at lunch in the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt, who was the one to fall into the desert, crushed his lungs, crushed his lungs, and was decorated, like the turtles of soup, who were loving the food.
The menu on that day was much more modest: tomato sauce boiled eggs, potatoes, and dessert, alluding to the dry Era.
Jane Ziegelman said, "This was an act of solidarity with the people who were grieving.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: "this was a message to the Americans about how they should eat at the same time."
Heights, that is the living couple, the food historian.
In his latest book, "Chop Suey," Mr. Coe's latest book, "Chop Suey," was right on China cuisine in America, and Mrs Ziegelman wrote in his book "97 Orchard" about a lifetime of food in the limelight.
The new book, which they worked with, and which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, tells the history of the food of America during the Great Depression.
With solidarity on the food themselves, the crisis began in the year 1929, which marks the start of the crisis, showing the Flatiron area of the village of Jesse Sandwell at a meeting with a reporter for dinner.
Mrs Ziegelman (54) ordered the king's cheese and Olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe (57) preferred to put on meat, turkey, potatoes, and vegetables.
The pair found it appropriate to discuss the reporter's bearish orders during the period of the crisis.
"these are enormously popular," Mrs Ziegelman said.
To place the salmon, the salmon, the dry bean salmon.
Then they spread the material with a material that was a cheap thing.
I consider that you have enough room for dinner.
Into his face, Mr. Coe.
"people like the bullet should be sitting at the foot of the bed," he said.
During the years before the crisis, especially in rural areas, the table was like an open buffet.
Women cooked meals for men working on the farm, and breakfast, lunch and dinner was served in the fresh cooking tours of the restaurant.
The Europeans, who died of hunger in World War I., were sending food to Europeans, explains the history of methods to cope with the fact that the nation is now an abundance center.
Mr Coe explained why he and his wife had a desire to write about this issue, saying, "This is a time when food has become a center for Americans, worrying."
The new budget regime was equally concerned: the mysterious food, such as the Sommers and stewardship, became the basic consumer product, Mrs Ziegelman said, adding that "stewardship is a great method for evaluating the remaining dishes."
The fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Over the years the meat, which has been at the center of American dishes, has become a prudent share of luxury.
Lots of interesting mixing for the value of calories and the taste of the test, and the sense of taste or general kitchen approach.
Mrs Ziegelman has been doing research for his book, which also includes recipes, while in the era of peanuts, he has prepared the onions trademark.
"this was not my favorite contribution at the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.
Mrs Ziegelman supported it: "this was the reality of
Add to the heat of the oven, with no common point.
Recipes in most of the home economy, this is a feature.
The home economy experts, including Louise Stanley, chief economist at the Federal Bureau of Home Economics, said that between 1923 and 1943, the country's eating habits were more startling than ever before.
Describe the equilibrium and articles published in the newspapers and magazines, encourage women to be "saving," and promote the struggle to recycle delicious food for their purposes.
"it is a feast of tasty restaurants.
I like the attitude of Herbert Hoover, let alone cake food, as the government answers to the hungry citizens of the very end.
On the one hand, he told the public that simple concepts of farmer foods, while on the other hand, turn into millionaire intellectual dishes.
"I like to eat European cuisine, like a salad sauce," Mr. Coe said.
Then, wearing the appropriate jackets at the dinner table, almost completely covered in gold, was a meal in the room.
Very far from reality.
His wife, Eleanor, was not encouraged by it to be an example with her, even though the vice president could fall into the same mistake.
As far as the book is concerned, Mrs Roosevelt was hired by a deputy who never championed the tastes of the White House in taking the job, but at the same time, she began to be presented with "the most somber food prepared."
When the country was back on its feet, most of the methods to eat during the crisis were set aside.
According to Mrs Ziegelman, the focus is on calories and nourishment and the way science is applied to cooking food.
The couple, while writing the book, said Mrs Ziegelman had learned a lot from her mother's eating habits - for example, the meal was never thrown out.
"food waste was really scared of it," Mr. Coe said.
Mrs Ziegelman spoke of the old memories: "I was really sick of people."
Care of the collapse of cases.
Shortly after collecting the slick in the slick, he and Mr. Coe issued a taste of what they were preparing at home: the dinner at the home of the President Roosevelt was dry, sweet.
Mrs Ziegelman said "this was a dry melting statement," and added that the number was most often applied to this modest tariff.
I did not have the cream; it was just dry, a little flour, sugar, water, and tarp.
Everybody was hesitant to find a way to brown the blood of the branches.
Not surprisingly, it wasn't too bad.
Mr. Coe took the second and third lesions.
Saving his wife, like the one who could have been "a bit or a bit of nuts," would have been good.
Merck with the fight for the hepatitis C patent will receive the Gilead attorney fees
According to the decision of the US district justices, Gilead Sciences Inc has won the right to receive attorney fees related to the case of hepatitis C patent filed with pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
After the judge found that Merck had failed to detect a series of misbehaviour, which also includes a denial of individual masterpieces and other unethical practices, Gilead was relieved of paying $200 million in compensation for the violation of two Merck patents related to the discovery of drugs that had been the major success of Gilead in June.
In Thursday's hearing, U.S. District Judge Beth Laban testified that Gilead was entitled to compensation for the fees charged during the defence of the case.
Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, the judge of the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can improve more than 90 percent of liver patients.
The trial dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming that they were entitled to the ownership of the laboratory work for the touch of the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
Control of the US-backed forces, Membic said, was taken from an entirely Islamic state
On Friday, a spokesman for the group said the US-backed forces had completely seized control of the city of Membic, in the north, near the Turkish border with the latest Islamic State fighters inside the city.
Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG) are hiding in the city, following the separation of a group of militants in the clearing phase of the city.
In an alliance with the SDG, Shari Dervis, from the Membic Military Council, reported that Rouen had freed the civilian hostages over 2000, which they found themselves in the hands of militants.
"the city is now completely under our control but we are conducting the removal work," he said.
Clinton family won $10.75 million in 2015, and paid federal taxes by 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton, the candidate of the Democrats on Friday, and her husband earned $10.75 million last year and are in effect, paying 34.2 per cent of the federal tax on the tax declarations of 2015.
In 2015, the Clinton family has contributed $1 million to charity institutions, mostly in the Clinton Foundation, where former president Bill Clinton won about $5.3 million from his speech fees, and the former foreign minister has declared that he has earned $3 million for his book, which comes from Simon & Schuster's publishing house.
Clinton's nominee, U.S. Senator, Virginia Tim Kaine, issued 10 years of tax declarations with his wife, Anne Holton.
Of 20.3 percent in federal taxes in 2015.
Clinton campaign officer Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement, "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the standard for financial transparency."
In contrast to this, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake avoiding statements about his tax statements before and taking a step back.
Although not all laws require US president candidates to present their tax declarations to the public as a tradition.
Donald Trump and his lawyers, a New York businessman, testified that the reason for the rejection of the declaration was an audit conducted by the Revenues Administration.
In conjunction with the statements of democratic candidates, Clinton campaign officer Ian Shafer took his "tweets" out of it.
On Thursday, Donald Trump, acting in private lawsuit, told CNN that he would not allow Donald Trump to publish them until he checks.
Mitt Romney, who is the candidate for president in 2012, and other of his critics, including Donald Trump, the group that is critical of this reject situation, said his contributions to charity institutions, business agreements and many other links, including those with Russia, posed questions.
Clinton went on to explain that this was an online video that he had put under pressure on Friday to explain the taxes on top of Trump.
Thursday, in an economic speech in Michigan, expressed this problem.
Himself, he told the crowd, "After ten years of doing every vice presidential candidate, he refuses to publish his tax statements.
POLITICO has reported that Trump has paid almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and on Friday, the New York Times business section columnist shared a series of tax lawyers and accountants that the situation could still persist in this way.
Federal tax rates have become a major problem in the Presidential election.
Clinton has submitted a rule proposal, named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who gains tax payment of at least 30 percent of those earning over $1 million a year.
Obama also supports the offer.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Nebraska, Berkshire Hathaway, the group that operates there, is to come and present the tax declarations to the challenge.
Buffett testified that he was passing the IRS control and that he was "afraid" of the voters, not from the tax collection institution.
During the campaign, Clinton released their tax statements, which were up to 2007.
Currently in New York, the Clinton family, which is living in Chappaqua, has an average federal tax payments of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and the combined tax rate is about 40.5 percent.
Clinton's family reporting for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income comes from wages.
The main investments are a low cost index investment fund, and the Clinton family has declared that the dividends and interest income is $109,000.

Just put the red carpet, cut off the pig, support the preservation of elephants in Tanzania
The environmentalists in Tanzania are using an unusual method to prevent elephants from entering human residential areas; they put them in the dust of red hot chili peppers.
The method has proven effective, and the idea was proven effective a few years ago with the Honeycomb Foundation and the US-based nature Protection Union, which took steps to promote it; villages in northern Tanzania have begun to educate volunteers about their use of violence to protect their homes and crops without damaging the animals.
Before most people to defend himself.
Friday, the World Fil Day, which is dedicated to the protection of animals.
"we have seen changing the position of these communities since we developed the set," said Honeywell executive director Damian Bell.
The first two steps are to hold the last keeper and steal the chorus.
In cases where this is not possible, the so-called "red pepper" is being taken.
Add the dust with red hot chili peppers, put off with a cut, will only funnel the deficit to shut down.
When burned, the sound of a blast begins with the sound of red hot chili peppers.
Even a breathing fleet is enough to send it in the opposite direction.
The last resort is throwing fireworks into the air, a loud, bright modem, which is to use a mango.
Jewish filmmaker has hit the hotel somewhere in Berlin, where he removes the telephone code of the Arabs "request" - RT News
Meanwhile, a French filmmaker of Jewish descent has been charged with censorship in the media after it was revealed that the Hermitage in Berlin had failed to list Israel's telephone code and that the employee had "demands" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, one of the authors of the "Shoah" document related to the genocide, expressed outrage at the Hermitage Museum in Berlin with an open letter to the German broadcaster FAZ.
Lanzmann briefly tried to find Israel on the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel in his previous stay.
However, it was not among the states that could be sought directly from the room.

Filmmaker, to get an explanation of the situation to the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the response was "a shock to him."
The hotel secretary said this measure was taken with a deliberate decision of the "Hermitage-Hotels administration."

According to Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Jakov Hadith al-Handling, described the situation as "a great shame."
Some of us are appalled and very surprised.
This is really a great shame.
I have been in Germany for this and have been in the chain of such a hotel much bigger outrageous.
There's no need for that.
We expect that the hotel will be the result of that, "he said.
That's great reaction to the online environment; people described it as scandalous.
Some have accused the Hermitage Hotel of "succumbing to the so-called demands of Arab clients."
In another send, the hotel highlighted the street near a synagogue and highlighted the "Ufanfare," which was highlighted in the Kurd street.
Der Spiegel reported that the hotel was quick to point out that this incident was the result of "carelessness," and Lanzmann quickly dismissed these accusations.
Suddenly, the deutsche Zeitung said that one of the representatives of the Hermitage was telling me that "there was never a direct orders to be included in the fast search list of Israel."
And now they have added the code.

Interest rates are expected to fall further in the coming days.

However, the rate should be below 9 percent annually.
If this discount continues the process, we are also launching the monthly 0,70 interest campaign to extend a few months.

But interest rates on loans must come under 9 per cent on an annual basis.
I am glad to see that this is only in the housing sector and in the real market, with the positive psychology and the unprecedented solidarity of citizens in every sector of the housing pandemic.
Police Holding YKB Adnan Polat: we expect full support from the banks

After the coup attempt, the real estate-led campaign started construction with 70 interest and a large sales campaign with a maturity of 120 months.

The chairman of the Supervisory Authority (BDDK), Mehmet Ali Akben, issued a statement on the President's warning of a "credit recall" for banks.
"banks are turning to credit for an opportunity because of the conditions of the market and if they do with different sites, we will certainly not allow it," Akben said.
Those who bring such complaints and information to us, in the name of the Bank and the company, are the followers of the BDDK complaint line.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said yesterday that banks are now warning: "I am sure that, when rates fell, credit prospects were expanding, and our country will open a new era in front of both investors and banks."

More than 500,000 Russian tourists are expected
The professional hotel Managers' Association (POYD) President Ali Kizmountain announced a positive route to Turkey-Russia relations ahead of the July 15th coup attempt at the EXPO 2016 Antalya exhibition area and said there has been a certain revival in tourism from Russia to Antalya.
"I expect that both tourism and agriculture will be very positive developments in terms of both tourism and agriculture, with a monopoly on construction," he said.
And Russia is very close to each other, the two countries have traditional relations based on the years.
"we as sectors on this road by the leaders of the two countries think we can make progress very quickly and we will close the targets as soon as possible," he said.
If the coup attempt would exceed 1 million of the number of Russian tourists who came to Turkey, the deaths were reported.
But we lost a month at the time when we were in the high season, so the target was to shrink.
If I still do charter flights, I think we will exceed 500,000 figures.
There may also be a question of extending the season until the end of October or even on tape.
In such a case may be additional flights per year.
I guess this positive atmosphere will be judged very well by the Russian people.
To them in the harvest.
With this momentum, perhaps we will force the 700 riders.
If they are hopeful for 2017 in terms of the Russian market, the deaths of the two countries as well as the economy of Russia will recover if the number of Russian tourists next year could be over 3 million again.
"with the lifting of the ban on the permit of public staff, domestic reservations have begun minor, POYD President Kizzi said." there are returns in the annulment, new bookings are to be taken. "
"we have a hopeful expectation with prayer," he said.
"it would be very good if we could bring in 100-200,000 people per month from Iran in the 1.2-2 months," he said, citing a very positive development in lifting the round ticket sales ban imposed on travel agencies by Iran after the coup attempt.
Inspiration to renew the current credits?
Discuss with the bank you first loan and discuss how the new interest conditions are affecting your credit.
Lenders calculate the cost of using a new loan at an early closing fee (typically 1.5-2 per cent of the used wage) along with a lower rate of interest.
If you are still advantageous to include all costs, you can apply for the use of low interest loans.

Previously, the assets were confiscated
According to the indictment, prepared by the Adana Republican Prosecutor's Office for the Investigation of Terrorism and Organized Crime by the people and organizations affiliated with FETBC / PDY, the value of the amendment irregular in the zoning plan amounts to an increase in the value of the FET / PDY terrorist group, 17 suspects indicted in the Criminal Court.

Hussein Goodby: Gulen's demolition depends on the collapse of the 3 bears
FEI interpret the coup attempt by telling the man.
Hussein would sell the statements by saying:
Through my mind they attempted a coup, as they attempted to write this issue in the last 5-6 months, but they cannot do within the chain of command, "he wrote.
I do not know the two things; the first is to be this broadly common and deep, for example the Gendarmerie General Commander of 8 years and the competence of Mr. President.
Mr. President, the people who fight the most, how to pay attention to whom they chose, but the most important characteristic of them is an unprecedented privacy.
A multitude of two faces.
"this is not the business that FETBC can do," said one of the most important evidence points to such a deep sand.
Support from the CIA.
The CIA, this masterpiece was taken very early.
In 2014, it says, it will be replaced by the 1971 Vehicle Fuat East and Fetullah Gulen.
The people who are most interested in this era of relations between the lands and the CIA are the closest to the period.
Us pay the wages of the personnel of the armed forces, do not remember them after one man broke it out as follows.
When we learn it, we are in 2014.
Mahmut Bey's writing, after all, was not a statement that denied it.
Example, to be fair to orphans, is not captured in a row?
Who is curious about this.
The man had gone to Pensylvania 2 times in the last 25 days before the coup, he returned 2 days ago.
Fair orphans have gone 109 times since 2002, out of the home.
When you meet all of them, the topic of research has gone into research; all of those who run the moment are Fetullah Gulen from March 1999, which causes the US to go to the US with a avoiding research.
Will be seen, that they do not have to take an opportunity to go to Pensylvania.
But the real liaison with the CIA is that it can be detected from a couple of people; especially the police, who are supposed to be raising it from the police to the very people in the US.
WikiLeaks documents exist in the form of an association; and this association is holding joint meetings with the CIA.
15 years ago that links with the CIA were made to show the image.
I say it is an intelligence pool in Transylvania. 2 years ago.
The man working on the prime minister was working at the fair.
But the bad thing is; this information fell to the CIA as it fell in.
Gulen's demolition was tied to the collapse of the three bears; one base, which we base, was the friendly link that was, well, deep in the hip, there are those who say that even the coup attempt is still in his film.
Three feet, or a base support.
Questions of theft, theft, and right to vote, much of this base support.
Other two feet; political support, international support.
International support is still available.
The only thing that will break political support was Baykal and MHP managers documented that the tape was pulled out by FETBC.
Shortly after July 15, the "FETURE" of Mr. leader also uses, everyone has their eyes.
Gulen has a number that says, "I don't do that around me.
In my echo, he says, "Yahweh Hussein mosque, this girl blows very different dreams, they send me, they send me, because I am no longer banned, because the dream is not true."
When he received a sound recording, he told the people at the bar that the voice of the Barbarian husband: mentor friends had seen the dream, double the Hell Tweets.

Operation in the region.
Plotters interrupted by the vote of the TV transmissions
Private television, which owns a key share in preventing the coup attempt on the night of July 15th, has continued broadcasting thanks to a technical staff of the plotters in Turksat.
Is that hero of the rock...
"I take everything that ends when my friends killed my friends in the fire from the helicopter," Akkaya said in a statement.
I asked me to cut off the weapons and transmissions.
I just closed the local TV.
Bowls then saying that we should go away from the building to the right.
I spent up to 20 minutes in the part where the antenna was located.
"I still have some cables in here but I didn't touch the broadcasts," he said.
The plotters did not manage to cut the publication in Samanway TV to their experts.
Some terrorists were caught by police arriving 3 minutes before the scene.
The plotters returned to the building about 1 hour later by phone from them, understood that he continued to broadcast TV broadcasts, and at that moment, with the death of the rock, he described the voyage:
I took over the nurse that night at 8 o'clock in the evening.
He saw the entrust to us.
E-state and electrical system for each of my friends nurse.
We are gathering to drink tea, such as around the clock, during our modest flight by helicopter.
Again around the helicopter, there were more than a few air cars flying silent.
Have seen their names.
Unmanned aerial vehicles, which are probably not.
Halfway through the term, they were flying off.
11 years is, for the first time in my life, so close to the flight I was looking for the employee.
Then started a galaxy.
Apprehension we have learned that the bridge has been closed.
During that stretch, our general manager was instructed to come to the building with friends who were not at that moment in safety.
I went to the employee to get the information, I learned that all the publications in the TRT have fallen.
5 minutes, the TRT transmissions were cut.
Tram was looking at the main sand but I got access.
Our control stations have come back to TRT publications and have begun to read the statement.
The deputy governor of the town of Halil, with the instructions of the governor, urgently cut off the TRT publications.
Tram 3 channels for a wide broadcast that we have begun to work in order to cut the publication.
Just before the Prime Minister Binali Yildirim had heard of that.
To the manager of the TRT to give us a bit of resistance psychology.
Trains cut, we heard the voice of the helicopter after a while.
When we got out, the employee was blow to the helicopter everywhere, aside from everyone.
Hiding a building on the back side.
I have a total of 12 people.
Then we crossed the helicopter from the helicopter to the soldiers.
Caught a few of our fellow soldiers.
We found out that we were to leave them alone.
During that stretch we caught our general manager and saw that they were on the knee.
Soldiers speak for themselves.
To let the one hit, they were afraid of one.
Then walked away from us all.
Commanders in chief, who will not ask again, he started shouting.
In one of the words in the shot, we thought: we have no news from the home but a instructions came from us, in the exact moment he was TRT.
That means that there is a resistance.
I felt that moment I gave up my own life.
Entries in me.
I stood up without knowing what to do at that moment.
The only thing at that moment was that the helicopter was opened fire to my friends in the garage.
Nizhny Novgorod thought that 10-15 friends were killed and that they will eventually kill us in the proportions that a relief has collapsed on me.
Cut all transmissions with the exception of the early commander in chief, 'he said.
Local channels to satellite while we have parts of the system.
Over 200 local channels, 80 of which are broadcasting from the room.
I came to this room.
Including no national broadcast.
If I cut them off and all that had been cut off, at least until then the support income would reach outside help.
Expenditure up to the place where the entries were received.

This data is the value of information collected from all over the world.
Stream all night
The estimate of rain moving at about 60 miles per second is a reminder that this visual feast in the sky is a good way to shed light on the northeast, which can be watched throughout the night in a good way.
Throughout the year, more than 100 lakes have occurred in the rainforest, he said, noting that after the Perseid lake rain was observed on December 4 and 17, it was a remarkable nature event.
Less educated, former footballer, he
Even though the balance was overturned, less educated former footballer Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a populist, led by a widely devout entrepreneur, Fetullah Gulen from Tashkent, has been the winning alliance of highly educated followers of dozens of universities and educational institutes.
Above, the Policy in an article in the last week of the sentence.
He is a little educated and former football player; he is an elementary school graduate and former football player; he is widely praised by Gulen followers as a broad entrepreneur, and similar articles are often cited in Western media.
And then, on the other hand, in his article "Why America and / or Western opponents of the rising sun rises?," they are trying to explain the sentence with which he began.
Western opponents in Turkey are unaware of Turkey's history, which analysts see as a situation during Erdogan's era.
In fact, according to statistics, during the first decade of his term, his Western opponents decreased or had, on average, be read as a term.
Since this was in ten years with the United States in the synchronised manner, it was good relations.
Referring to Erdogan's criticism of Israel for its failure to put a clear policy on Turkey and the refugee crisis in Turkey, the PKK, which has been critical of Erdogan's anti-Assad regime in Turkey, said some of the figures, such as the Syrian arm of the PKK, should be left alone in Turkey, while the PKK's Syrian arm forces its predecessor, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to downplay Turkey's struggle with DAV and reduce our unity with US support and Baghdad leadership.
As a result of the bloody coup, we lost 247 people, our so-called allies, the EU countries and the United States until proven the failure of the coup, they expect to build peace and stability in Turkey, with no emphasis on democracy and the elected government, let's say.
And while 11 Charlie Hebdo employees in Paris were killed in the protest march, many leaders from around the world took part in the protest march, but when it came to fighting tanks for democracy, 247 people were killed in a month after the coup attempt in which any speaker from any western country will be forgotten?
The issue of refugees a few times a year for the president or senior representative of those who sent it to the lower levels, what will we say?
If the Hurriyet newspaper had broken the windows, all the EU and US ambassadors would go to visit the past, and how to evaluate the bombing during a solidarity visit to Parliament?
In the first two weeks when the coup in Egypt took place in the first two weeks leading up to the coup leader Sisi shake hands with the coup leader, it should be remembered that democracy is being rebuilt in support of the coup leadership, who at every opportunity in western countries are concerned about its democracy rather than the lack of sincere in Turkey?
Still, 95% of the public view Gulen as responsible for the coup, even allowing him to be freely in the US now enough to infuriate the Turkish people.
If the above plan is included in the background, I think it is clear that the rising West / America opponents will not be able to be released with just that.
And he is currently in recession, he is not even considering the US effect...
Means that the polling stations were never unaware of the theme of the
With the growing intelligence of his own people, who are small, who do not think like him, he is "ignorant" of the growing intelligence that he can steal from the same tellers after the night of July 15th?
This is how people look after the state and democracy, and then they seek to answer the question "where are we wrong?
But the questions that need to be answered are so much more than that?
The officers, who served in various positions until the treacherous, and the officers granted them the right to use their weapons in the state, refused to enter into the status of "Hain" for a moment, and did not want asylum from foreign states.
Also, we live in a mental hit environment and we gaze at people looking at how to deviate from the behaviour of the people as directed to their behaviour.
Sulphur declarations when it comes to the coup d'Ã©tat...
For the participants of this action in cities like the cities of Syria, there was simply a point of view?
An officer bombs the parliament of his own country?
Packed with the bedside of the mattress, we should not fall into an illusion, like waiting for appropriate behavior.
Other responsible to let you know that everything that is responsible for everything is not just FET.
Politics scuffle, and as a profession of hatred, there are also cadres who make the necessary contributions to the tragedies that occur.
Bears, offering themselves as "created," are all types of rule out behaviour, and even the term biographical is natural to the masses.
People hate their own people when they are given weapons on how to shoot this public even at the end.
Way of democracy, we know the way
I say something very simple: on the evening of the 15th July in Turkey, the popular soldier, FET7000, assists in racket, racket, 250 killed in the series and set up a lot to save democracy.
But behind the 15th of July, 1992; 2002 and 2012; there are three terms, including 2012 and the aftermath.
There are three changes that have been prepared in this three period: economic, social, political.
Social change has drawn two major phenomenon: the rural areas of the text, and the migration of these migrations to the centre after a very long period of time around the cities.
I moved this on Wednesday through the metro.
The subway is not the most important element of social change if they do not pass, he emphasised.
The same finger is the second major change in bridges and roads.
Contribution to the modernisation of the road and bridge is more easily understandable.
Road income, economic and social structure change.
In our country is one that has changed the structure of politics.
This date was at the height of the bridge that I spotted with me.
Built, at the Bridge.
Of this 1950 peasant movement in the 1960s.
Ozal continued with the second bridge, which we now name as the 15 July Martyrs Bridge.
Even routes to them - the relationship established between the centre.
That is also a sign of how a social change course is monitored.
Of the name of Demirel and the great masses of soda at the centre.
To them the ideology of the centre.
The party did the third bridge in several decades.
Because of the whole rate of migration.
People from satellite cities.
Created a slightly closed system in that areas.
The party of local governments gave people, jobs, social status, they voted for the party.
The masses are thus not at the centre of osteoporosis in the environment, and the centre is then asked to come to themselves as well.
This formation has to do with the ongoing wear discussions ahead of the party (1992-2002).
These discussions are conservative, builders and stoning people not to integrate with the centre, but the obligation to stand side by side with the masses.
The party acted with the method I mentioned in 2002, when the masses were politicised, in politics, of maturity.
Take note, then, that the construction of the 3rd bridge is the co-chair of the democratic fight on 15 July.
That means that history and sociology coincide.
To add another dimension to this: the party's move, as mentioned, is not limited to just Istanbul bridges.
One more interesting thing: the party is now integrating the surrounding cities with the central cities.
It through two bridges.
One, on the veterans Bridge.
Two, the bridge of 1915.
Add ways to this.
Turkey, from Thracian to Izmir, will now reach another route.
If you know what this was, Izmir will now be a different city.
Let's get inside the party, let's say, Izmir can no longer take it from the outside.
Now Bursa, now the cities of Thracian, will turn into another five and social geography.
Thanks so much!
15th martyrs are the stars of this great genre.
Fenerbahce Van Persie in the dressing room and cheerful
Fenerbahce continued his training in the morning with preparations for the Grastic games.
Loss of the facilities of coach Vitor Pereira, which began in the hours of training, lasted for a total of 1 hour 30 minutes.

Notice to the person who is complaining to Gulen...
New developments related to the operation of the Fenerbahce.
"the sports business has raised a name for Fethullah Gulen, a journalist who participated in a programme broadcast on CNN Turk and announced that this operation was done by FETBC."
"a lightning day flight is what this individual is doing next to Fethullah Gulen," he said.
This individual will then transfer these words to Fethullah Gulen.
Why are they paid to him?
The head of the club, who is the most fan of this mentality that could hurt him.
"the match-fixing case was used to liquidate Aziz Yildirim."
This quote was followed by a statement from the key lawyer of the Trial of Faik Light.
The report, published in Light Reports, appeared in the programme and paid tribute to the people who complained to Fethullah Gulen.
Is the words of Faulkner Light:
He says he has something to shield about Fethullah Gulen.
From Azerbaijan, while on private flight.
St Luke is a humorous man, one of the critics of the west, with or without the sentence.
Then the sentence is maybe a little wings.
May react to some of that sentence.
This sentence is grown in one place.
Ultimately, he maintains, so much so that the businessman, like Hac, has to go to the house to be accepted with such tolerance, not the business.
These are what the business says, too severely.
The only problem, of course, is that it isn't.
In the meantime, try a football team.
Is delighted to have direct links to some of the players and managers and the referee...
Muharrem Usta: clothes are different
The head of them, Muharrem Usta, extended the hand of friendship to Fenerbahce.
Noting that Turkey's issue is a matter for all clubs, he said, "79 millions are on the side of this country."
Stick, we should take a stand.
If there was a problem with Fenerbahce, injustice was done to me, I stood behind Fenerbahce.
"but the fixing between them and Fenerbahce is different," he said.
Price prices have been announced
Axed, he said: "as a union, we have established the price of a kilogram of live victims as 18 lira."
"we have also identified the price and price of the live kilogram again at 17 lira, which is what we described as the second class," he said.
The animals, which will not be victims last year, have also been put up for sale, he noted, while citizens are required to pay attention to the victims:
Need to be careful of earrings, especially in animals.
Animals are also very important to be healthy.
Our citizens are victims for this while checking the passports of the animals in their passports.
The external look of the victim is also alive and alive, to be taken on by its members.
In the sky, or of the lack of it, as it might have gone.
Last year there were no victims in the animals that had been put up for sale and sold.
Animals, of which a victim has gone to the age of 2.
Then we can understand the look of the animals in their work.
To fill the age of 2 as the cover of the animals in which we have proved
But the age of the animals, which is smaller, has not come out of this.
The animal is seen as great, but the cover can never be seen.
Cover the teeth are already great because the others are just noticeable.

Robert Amsterdam was very telling about the FETURE!
Robert Amsterdam, an official of the Amsterdam & Partners law firm, which is legally investigating the activities of the Fetullahan Terror (FETBC), has written an article in the US magazine Forbes about how to organise FETBC.
"it is quite clear that the organisation of about 150 contracted (charter) schools in the United States will be treated well under the direction of the organisation, which is closely related to how businesses operate in the United States," said Amsterdam Gulen, chief executive of FETBC.
Amsterdam, seven months ago by Turkey, said it was exploring the applicability of affiliated companies and schools, stressing that so far it is "shocking" to qualify.
Amsterdam, commented on the article:
The attendant tells us that the Gulen organization has a strict hierarchy of instructions.
These instructions generally refer to the meetings on the face of Gulen and the Poconos.
Top management group of seven people (in the consultation group).
Instructions to the advisory committee of this group.
The instructions then go to the regional imam, the country's imam, the country's imam, the regional imam, the district's imam, the district's imam, and students' houses (light homes) and students.
Businessmen, bureaucrats and officers are working at different levels, according to their positions and support within the organization.
The organisation has opened 55,000 jobs around the world, the largest contracted school network in the US, covering Amsterdam, where taxpayers paid hundreds of millions of dollars each year from taxes to these schools.
Amsterdam has reported that much of this money is being directed by members of the organisation themselves and transferred to the "elected" subcontractors.
Amsterdam, explained the functioning of this:
Magnolia schools, based in California, are linked to the Goodwood schools and shared the same office the equivalent of the annual service to the company while the $700,000 was captured.
Amsterdam, as another example, showed the Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma.
Amsterdam has also paid an extra $3.1 million to the property owner in this school, as well as controls the school and property owner of the company, the same people affiliated with Gulen, he said.
Noting that there are similar situations in 46 franchises which hold the largest place in the nation, Amsterdam noted that smaller companies linked to FETBC have paid money with items such as software license, curriculum purchase.
"this gave me examples of the abuse of nearly $28 million of American taxpayers," Amsterdam said, underscoring the fact that each other was rich.
"and this is precisely what we have found so far."
As far as something has been done to prevent such incidents, Amsterdam noted that the situation in the language of last time was going to get worse, after all they had been reminded that the Department of Education had begun to investigate irregularities.
Amsterdam, the apparent normal functioning of schools, stressed that many employees had no information of what kind of corruption.
"however, in fact, these schools are working like a snow machine for Gulen."
"Gulen then uses the massive amount of money for political donations in an effort to conceal his lawless activities."
According to the testimony of a former American teacher who worked in these schools, he said some employees in the Gulen schools had meetings separately, describing the transfer of a certain section of their salaries to the organisation. "the members of the Turkish Armed Forces are believed to have worked in similar functioning."
The coup instigators strengthened their positions over the years.
"however, on the surface, the army was collecting power behind a parallel force while doing business in the normal way," he wrote.
Amsterdam, the article said:
The policymakers in the United States have questions of interest in events between July 15 and 16, and this is something that is to be expected.
The two allies, however, have dealt with their diplomatic level, while individual state authorities need to wake up to the swift violation of US laws in Gulen's operations.

Paying attention to the habit of children
Dr. Bilgin, a professor of dentistry at the Faculty of Medicine, said that children have been relieved with these sanitation by making it a need to emulate the children from their first age.
"it is an event that occurs in children from birth to 4 years old, starting from birth."
Of most of the babies.
The need to satisfy the need for emulsion of the finger EMEN child after the age of 1 to 1.5 is not for the mother to rectify and to be relieved of the finger.
"it can be found in the behaviour of white-collar workers when the moment is left, when there is a blanket, and when there is a blanket," he said.
Stressing the importance of fingerprinting behaviour on the basis of child-child relations and the lack of confidence in the children's relationship, Dogan stressed that the effects of this behaviour on dental health are:
Fingerprint behaviour has a negative impact in shaping the child's dental structure.
As a result of the press that arose during the embankment, they were pushed forward, while in the bottom, they pushed back.
This leads to the position behind the lower jaw, the groom, and the balance of the dental structure.
Physical reflection of this is the reflection of speech disorder and the closure of the aesthetics would be in poor sight.
It should be noted that, during the ages of 6 and 7, if there were no early solution, there could be a much more complicated treatment process, "said Dogan.
"for this reason, children today must be kept under control in the structure of the eye and hearing controls," he concluded.
Close to the treatment of the new one: the phoenix,
After treatment, patients naturally like to use glasses.
To solve this problem in our patients, they have long been very focused on the makers that are already in use.
With the use of the last of the trifling makers, the success of treatment in this area is one step further.
The difference from the other makers of the Trifours is the ability to provide a clear view not only from the distance or close distance, but also in the distances described above.
Distant, close or intermediate distance from the treatment of disorders
Seeing the culprit in the distance, it represents a point we use very often in our daily lives.
As an example, the cars are holding indicator panels, holding our computers, or 60-70 cm, as we define the distance from the distance.
Trips are also correct in the distance, thanks to the fact that our patients do not notice close or distant difference in any way they need to use the glasses.
Tribulation is another advantage provided by the authorities to reduce the complaints of the night.
"there is no difference from the normal floor treatments for the treatment of phoenix, which is applied for both distance views."
Triphoid treatment is applied to our patients with a procedure of 7 to 10 minutes to comfortably tolerate health.
And the next day, our patients can return to their normal life.
More specifically, the use of computers, which is more than the use of computers, and a more active life for people who love to raise the quality of life from an operation.
You also have to fill the age of 18 which can be applied to each patient to learn whether this procedure is suitable for your eye diseases specialists.
These sausages are not used in vascular heart surgery!
Puberty is a disease that has increased in frequency in recent years.
Genetic convergence is the priority factor; long working hours, standing for a long time to come to a halt, and the ability of long-time residence to increase.
Hormones used in heart surgery?
If there is a heart attack in the name, what is the solution to such questions as often by people.
Is the answers to these questions.
On the legs, there are two types of vascular system:
1.To be dirty is the lining of the lungs which led to the lungs and leg, which is the main cause of the deep topvascular system.
These are, in our deep philosophy, and take their name from the surface.
Since the problems in this topography are more rare, the disease cannot be closed, and this travesty is applied to medication treatments.
Lying on the legs is dirty, which leads to the lungs and is in combination with the deep topvascular system, which we say is the superficial topvascular system.
This system is composed of two large and two small SAFETY amino acids.
This is the fourth in the cerebral cortex, and it can develop.
These surgeries, which can be used in heart surgeries, are the major SAFETY of the superficial topography.
In the absence of these amino acids, there is no damage to the body and can therefore be used in heart surgery.
However, they can be used in the heart surgeries so that the groom needs to be healthy.
Heart, because it is a very important body.
These are taken with the surgery of the teeth or lasers left on the ground, burning deep in the intestines, reducing the workload and the healthier the leg.
Among the public, there is a misbelief that sausages can be used as spare parts, though.
These sausages have never been and never used in heart surgery!
Other gigs that can be used in the surgery.
Of spare vascular systems that can be used in surgery; under the breast, around the head, and in the arm.
So you have to wait for the sausages to use for the heart and to worry about this.

Meaningful message prior to the announcement of the Super
The head of the Galatasaray Sports Club has issued a statement ahead of the Super Cup Finals match between Galatasaray and Besiktas.
During that moment you have to draw attention to the unity and draw of Turkish football in that words:
Galatasaray and Besiktas, two established and two plumbers of Turkish sports, will face the Super Cup at the Konya metropolitan Torku Arena on Saturday evening (August 13th).
This game is neither the first, nor the last game in the competition, which has left a team of two Charges behind.
But the timing is a very vital match.
Also, as we all know, our country was a big hit on the night of July 15.
The coup attempt by the Fetullahan Terror / Parallel State Restructuring / Parallel State Restructuring (FETBC / PFDI) has been transformed, thanks to the unity and draw of all segments of society.
That night as a nation, we were paying heavy costs.
Martyrs.
I have a great number of veterans.
This bitter price has once again reminded us of the virtue of democracy, not the quarrels of these lands, and of the necessity of peace.
The representatives of the Turkish sport that night also objected to the coup as the only voice, the single heart; all along the side of democracy.
Previously, in these critical days of sport, we need more than ever.
Our precious opponent of the genius of our beloved President, Suleiman Vega, died on the 2nd anniversary of the new football season, which was named after the captain of our club Turbo, who just before the start of the new football season, I wish this match to be an initial match of love and peace in the Turkish sport.
And Besiktas fans will share half the match in front of the stands at the end of the match, regardless of what the winner will be in our country and the sport.

Underlined, while SCOT Callum Skinner flew home
The Great Britain Team trio retained their title from London 2012, while Kerr was on the race track to victory last night in the men's race.
Glasgowicz, 23, took the lead in the race, namely, a Chris Hoy, who took the lead, and this young, appreciated New Zealand clothes returned home with the triumph of this legend.
The four-year event, which won five of Hoy's six Olympic gold, was a shock.
And Hoy had retired but reiterated it after finishing sixth in the world championship in London in March.
The problem between Beijing and London was that the expert's initial player, Jamie, was not changed.
Exactly Hindes made it out at the moment.
Hoy's retirement was also a vacuum, as Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill up.
SCOT has previously seen the potential of aggressiveness, and British coaches have not abandoned Skinner.
The champion, along with Hoy four years ago, is the champion, Kenny and Skinner have broken the Olympic record in the first round, though New Zealand set this record again.
And British trio, duel for gold.
Hindes were a bit behind in their own round, but Kenny brought the team forward, and Skinner was on it.
Hindes are using a larger tool that will slow him down and keep up with Kenny in particular, which is a big part of the transformation that was the change in this strategy.
Hoy watched them from the BBC as the expert commentator, and when they were on the podium, he ran afoul of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes in his eyes.
Skinner, 23, said: "this is an honour comparison."
I just want to give my best and I'm here to announce the step.
Then we beat the Olympic record and beat the world championships.
This is really unbelievable.
There's no better way to do this.
Hindes has admitted that he deliberately dropped the track after winning a victory with Kenny and Hoy in London 2012.
I later responded to this subject and did not have a method of making a request to the competitors.
This time around, there was no such problem for an incredible victory.
Hindes said: "we are like London, along with all the flags of Great Britain.
Founded just three months ago, we have a backup.
I lost a lot of world race for this reason, having won the Olympics again is a really incredible feeling.
This is just one event for a nation that has won seven of the 10 races in both Beijing and London, a medal.
This is the measure of progress we have shown in the last five months, five more days ahead of us successfully on the race track.
Kenny's stance, namely, shows that Hoy's dream of winning three gold medals in a single Olympics is not too impossible.
This is exactly what Hoy is younger than 12 years of age, and he is also a 23-year-old (who was born March 23 at the same time as Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister, a sports past sacred history) desire for six gold medals and a silver medal.
This means the same level with Hoy.
Kenny, after that, will be the sprint race; the race will begin today and last for three days.
Bolton, 28, said: "for the time being, I just enjoy it.
Team events are all the best events.
You can win together with your friends.
To be honest, when you win alone, people feel alone.
Hindes said: "if he wins two more gold medals, he should be given the title of Knight."
This is only the event of this Sunday medal but there is a lot of good news for Britain.
Veteran Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull have finished first in the rankings for the four-year team race.
Track finished at 3: 51,943.
London set the world record for the winner of the gold medal in 2012 at 3: 51.59.
The first round and final (22: 42) will be determined in the second part today, and Wiggins will draw all the attention.
Before the round of rounds yesterday, officials called him to gauge the paint was a dispute with the officials.
The women's event, which runs tomorrow and will be completed, will be attended by the respective women at the event, Laura Trott, Joanna BAND, Elinor Barker and Milngavie from Katie Architecture 4: 13,260 for the world record.
The great Britain Team is counting on the strong bike team to take over the reins during the middle period of the Olympic Games and win many medals.
After major dominance in Beijing and London, expectations in Rio have been reduced.
In the background, there have been many bad developments involving retired coach Shane Sutton's resignation in April due to accusations of gender and tyranny, including the resignation of key figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
The track races on the track, however, show that the first night of the Great Recession is the perfect time to finish the epic credibility that can be proven at this time.
With the cancellation of the energy contract to Portland, the future of the suspected
The future of the Portland aluminium trace network in Victoria and the work of hundreds of workers fell into uncertainty following the expiration of a supply contract for one of the facility owners, which would lead to the cancellation of all supply contracts for the energy company that provides energy to the facility.
The move comes after a decision by the Victoria government earlier this year to grant subsidies to continue working at the facility.
20 years of fixed subsidies expires in November.
Alcoa in Portland may be at risk of business up to 2000.
Without any closure, up to 2000 jobs may be directly or indirectly at risk.
And there may also be additional chain effects that consume about 10 per cent of the entire electricity consumed by the network Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa Point Henry closed the stove, and this led to the closure of the Anglefield power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland facility is losing money and is facing a risk of closure.
These developments have proved to be the result of a few years of speculation over the future of the facility, initially based on the strength of the Australian dollar and the introduction of the facility's consumption fee.
Loy Yang, a Loy Yang of the Loy Yang A power plant located in the Valley of Latakia, said he expects the other three owners to take action to terminate their contracts.
The vast majority of the facility is owned by Alcoa and Alumina's joint venture, and China's CITIC, Japan, also has smaller shares of Marubeni Corp companies.
"the AGL expects to continue to work at the Portland facility; this means that there will continue to be a demand for physical electricity," he said.
AGL has said it is "balancing risk balancing contracts" that are supposed to take effect from November 2016.
The contracts are for a period of 12 months and will be completed in 2017.
"for this reason, AGL will continue to wait for the contracts to contribute to the fiscal year 2017," the energy company said.
The effects of AGL's exposure on the 2018 Fiscal Year and its aftermath may be limited to the current situation, with a strong term contract stance for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said the value of contracts in the accounts due to "bastards" had already fallen by as much as $187 million.
The decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect the ability of Alcoa to provide electricity supplies to the business or to the network," Alcoa said.
The U.S. government signed a 20 year contract in 2010; this contract was supposed to come into force in November this year but has yet to pull out of this contract.
The analysts remain vigilant about the possibility of closure due to economic woes in the sector, both in Victoria's Portland and Newcastle area and near Newcastle.
In response to the analysis earlier this week, AGL's operations chief, Stephen Mikkels, said Portland had used about 600 megawatts of energy each year, the equivalent of 900 megawatts.
If both of these facilities are withdrawn from the market, the demand for the [electricity] market will be significantly lower.
And as a producer, this is no good development for us, "he said.
Not only is he the star of the TV programme; himself, Vogue cover the number of September
She is the fourth daughter of the model and executive mother Kris Jenner (20), who is the fourth daughter of the group that looks forward to the US Vogue cover of September.
A Estee Lauder brand ambassador, and Milan, who were somewhat showing up in the fashion weeks of Paris and New York, announced this on his Twitter account on Thursday.
Himself in a room full of people with whom I Love "wrote the stuff on this cover.
After the gates were announced, it was strange (or just keeping Keeper Up with everyone's favourite show) that Rob and Caitlyn, who had troubles at the bar, released a reality video of the scenario; the video girl's brothers forgot to cover the door; in fact, they were preparing a surprise party.
Although this is almost all child television programmes with the stereotypes of every "birthday" section (see Seacrest at 8 in the morning, with sincerity in a cartoon), Kris is not included in this promotion by other girls in a way.
But with this development in the number of September, we are entering a new era of Kim Kardashian.
Himself, the sister of Kim, may have been past it on the cover of Vogue (the cover was shared with his wife Kanye West in April 2014) but the magazine was a success in itself on the cover of the network.
Vogue in September, the number selling for most of the year.
With the thickness of many coffee desk books from a fashion magazine, this number attracted the attention of many advertisers (Fashionista, last year's 832 pages of editing, found that there was advertising content in 615).
The cover stars are also a closely monitored process; the last two years have been leaked ahead of the official announcement of the magazine.
Among the women who had previously been included in the cover, is Linda, and said to her.
In recent years, there have been a lot of celebrities who have been "models" of the cover, too.
Oscar-winning Dior envoy Jennifer Lawrence took part in the cover in 2013, the next year, in honour of this honour, Lady Gaga.
But even if the magazine is described as the "paranormal model" of the generation by Mrs Jenn, even in the case of the previous category, it is pretty good.
These celebrities are not the young people of today who know how to draw the famous persons relative or reality show stars or the good Snapline video of today's young people (the reality is not all of them).
All of them are legitimate talent, women who come forward in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the cover of last year, had one of the best times of her career with the exit of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenson's success.
But due to the history of the show, Jenson's position in the fashion world will always be disturbing.
In June, the original Victoria's bore model, Saga Seymour, criticised Jenn and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "their time."
Jenny reports that the cover of Vogue will appear on the surface again this thought.
But the focus on satisfaction seems to be unfounded.
Themselves, Jenn was on the cover of the September numbers.
He is truly a super model.
Marc Jacobson himself to the show.
You are ignoring the Estee Lauder fund.
He himself, along with his sisters, sells pictures of their own on the walls of practice.
Nude photos of Cindy Crawford sells nude photos of her daughter to the magazine.
And empty times, perhaps only to see his brother Kourtney and their children in reality shows on television.
Social legal support centres of 300,000 people each year to reverse the
As the industry prepares for the impact of more funding cuts in operations, the already forced operations of over 165,000 people from the most protected areas of the nation have turned to social legal support centres.
The three out of five people in Disneyland (mostly the elderly, migrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, and those who will struggle with unfair eviction decisions are those who are not the source and are seeking representation) free legal advice and representation.
Opportunities for social legal support services, which have been exhausted, are set to be interrupted more.
Starting in June of next year, these legal support centres are scheduled to be deprived of more than 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrel, director of the Centre for Social Legal Support, reported that thousands of people have been turned away every year in the latest numbers of the National Union of Social Legal Support Centres.
Mr Farrel testified that if the federal government decision was not taken back, the situation would be much worse.
He himself said, "Disneyland's social legal support centres have a chronic lack of financial support, which means that thousands of people are unable to access vital services that are needed."
With the violent ties involved, the management of power and the people who struggle with the forces on the left, families in the process of secession, and workers who have been laid off in unfair ways... all of them encounter problems with the legal dimensions and cannot reach their needed help, according to this report.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent starting in June 2017, which means that without protection, thousands of Rhode Island residents will be forced to come out on top without help with more complex legal issues.
When people face a legal challenge to receive the support they need, the Minister of Justice and the governor of Disneyland, George brandis, immediately take this financing cut back to the box.
Last year, the government pledged to maximise the financing of legal support.
With the social legal support centres and the communities that serve them now, the Palaszczuk government should look to investment in this important work.
Staff of Donald Trump's campaign team following the alleged gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign team has been sued due to charges of no action after the North Carolina operations coach said he was shooting a gun at a staff tour with jihad in February.
The case was announced in a provincial court case filed by former software trainer Vincent Borreligious on Wednesday in the provincial campaign team.
Borreligious said he expects to be interested in the situation from the inside for months but later said he had "noticed" that it would not happen.
Bordini's complaint, as in the complaint, was brought to the attention of the director, who, in a gun, put his finger on the right sign and put Vincent on the right side of his knee. "
According to the complaint, Borreligious learned that at least four more people had experienced the same experience with Phillip after he complained to the leaders of the local and regional campaign team.
"there is no need for the weapons to be fired for damage," Borreligious said in his complaint.
The lawsuit was filed two days after the Republican presidential candidate responded to the crowd in North Carolina by saying that "second constitutional amendment scientists" (gun owners and gun supporters) could act in the case of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, and to choose their own judges in case of outrage.
Trump's campaign team is considering outside the context of these words in the media, and he does not support violence.
Borreligious, with no complaints, is due to the surveillance neglect of the campaign team and wants compensation from Phillip due to the attack, recession and moral damage.
Trump's spokesman, Hope Bread, did not return a quick return to the message seeking comment.
Efforts to reach Phillip failed.
In a local news subsidiary, WCCB, Phillip was recently reported from the campaign.
He also made a quick return to the call to his consulting company Innovative Group Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is waging a conflict.

Supervision of the asset fund recommission discussed in the
The Turkish Presence Fund, which is expected to be among the world's largest funds, silently lifted the affirmation of the law.
The fund was given a reconsideration because of the lack of oversight mechanisms but was discussed in the commission again without any changes.
"the assets belonging to the booths will certainly be excluded from the constitutional control mechanisms of this structure, which will consist of unemployment funds collected for unemployed workers, pensioners, workers' pension cuts, workers' pension cuts for the unemployed," said CHP Member of Parliament and Budget Commissioner Utley Jacket, discussing the AKP's offer of law.
In an effort to secure long-term funding for the government's investments and projects, the Turkish Presence Fund proposed legislation Tuesday with the view that the opposition should also be discussed.
But the AKP today rejected the proposal in the same form and brought it back to the Budget Commission.
The Parliamentary plan and the budget commission's CHP member, Essenehir Djordjevic, described the CHP's concern and concern to the CHP regarding the offer of the law.
"the establishment of this fund comes within the framework of the plan and the budget commission, the former Finance Minister Zekerija Temizal, who is at the helm of the CHP delegation, expressed our concern and concerns and offered to discuss it in detail."
The Government, which accepted our view, also withdrew the bill.
The bill came to the commission again yesterday in the same form.
"the government will insist on it to be issued from parliament within a week," he said.
"our biggest concern is that this law is the rule of law."
"the state's assets, which are owned by the public, will consist of pensioners, workers' pension cuts, the unemployment funds collected for the unemployed, revenues from privatisation, the privatisation of parliament and a structure which does not have any responsibility," he said.
"however, when such funds were established, Russia, China and the Gulf states have increased their oil revenues and trade, and the fund has been financed in this way," he said.
This is why the fund will consist of public funds, namely, the public's money.
With a total of 100 billion euros in the unemployment fund, 100 billion will be transferred from individual pension funds to employees, with 50 billion being transferred from privatisation.
"this means that the fund, which will consist entirely of public money, should be in public control, and that money should not be spent responsibly," he said.
When the resources of the state are collected, the borrowing of assets belonging to the state in a fund where collateral is excluded from the control of the parliament is unacceptable, he stressed, and concerns about the offer of the Presiding Fund code:
With such a large collection of public assets, spending on public behalf, business and transactions, only independent audit companies cannot pass on the audit.
Necessarily be in public control and should be a transparent structure.
Under the offer of the law, there are no provisions on the supervision and transparency of the Constitutional institutions.
Not be a limit on how much funds will be transferred.
No one will ever be able to account for how this fund was used.
Cited the financing of major projects as the purpose of the fund.
You don't need to establish a fund that controls outside the budget for this.
Why did you get into the budget?
When it comes down to it, the question is, "Why do you run out of gas and run out of parliament?"
The accumulation of money in the Fund is not against the transfer of investments, but it is not transparent, it is being done with the mechanisms that do not account, Jackie said. "there is a need for such a fund to be discussed."
But if the government insists that, then, such investment funds were established in other countries, we have to ensure that applicable international standards are in place.
Necessarily be structured in a way that is the mechanism of control and responsibility.
There will be no seathing on the part of citizens to account for their own money, which should be set up in a way that will account for it.
"we are pleased that the AKP will listen to our criticism in parliament, especially after the 15 July coup attempt," said Jackie Chan, who is staunchly opposed to the asset Fund law offer.
Offered this law, we hope to listen to our constructive criticism.
Use of national assets as rules, transferred, irresponsible to those of it, and although we are in public control.
"it can only be beneficial if these concerns are settled," he said.
On the offer of law to compromise between the AKP and the opposition, where the work was carried out.
"the indicator of trust we have in Turkey is the investment we have
"the investment of 30 billion USD in the last 5 years is a sign of confidence that we have in the future of our country," said Ford Automotive Chairman Ali Koc, speaking at a meeting in Istanbul.
He met with the Acting Chairman of the Board of Directors and Ford automotive Chairman Ali Koc, and the manager of several foreign capital firms, held by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO) at the meeting on "those who rely on Turkey."
"with our partners, our faith and confidence in our country is not just the so-called express concern, we are underlining it with our investments and conceptions," Ali said at the meeting.
Over the past 5 years we have invested 30 billion yen, a sign of confidence in the future of our country.
Turkey is a must for attracting more foreign investment considerations; a reliable and fair legal system, international standards of democracy, qualified labour and R & D, inovations, entrepreneurship and value-added ecosystem.
Over the past few years, our government has presented the most comprehensive incentives to our industry in our Republican history.
"I believe that we will be able to launch a new" Investment move "that we need with these incentives and integrated strategies.
"we now know it as global players, not just the problem of a single country, but as global players."
To us with a long-term view.
Unity and if we are in a draw, our problems will be solved.
160 years ago we were not able to bring this to the moment.
In these areas, we will continue to work.
"of course, we will build factories but we should be open to the horizon in this area," he said.
"Turkey is one of the top 10 countries for Shell."
The potential and believe in the heart of the future.
We have invested in many areas, especially energy, and are continuing to do so.
Our president, our prime minister, and our ministers are supportive of international investors for their work.
Work that has confidence for international investors.
"this is the direction that will improve the competitiveness of our country," he said.
"on August 10th, the Global CEO will come to Turkey," said Dr. Altan Demirel, President of Sanitary / Novartis Turkey and the Middle East Region.
But the travel was postponed.
We are opposed to it.
Because of the arrival of the CEO, too.
Bulletproof cars, such as the protection of mercury.
Then when it came here, everything was normal.
Bodyguards and left the car and happily returned home.
Investment in a country, similar to marriage.
Before that would be promised, if everything goes well and you are getting married by the long-term plan.
And we are married and have no intention of divorce.
Out onto the mattress!
The Prime Minister Binali Yildirim addressed businesspeople with a teleconference at a consultative meeting on "those who rely on Turkey," organised by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry.
"we have not been able to rehabilitate the industrial sector in the industrial sector at 4.0," said Prime Minister Yildirim Yildirim, who said Turkey's industrial sector will ensure the rule of law.
"the value added is high, we take care to seize the 2023 objectives of our country, the engine of our country, the industrial revolution, the IT and technology revolution, and we have to do it," he said.
On the night of the 15th of July, he added a large gulag onto Turkey, adding, "The future of our country, those who try to destroy democracy, do not even think about bombing our parliament, if they were assent, we would have spoken to another today."
With the coup management was seized, the national will has been removed and the countries of the world have fallen from the league, we would talk to a Turkey among the 3rd world countries.
"it is our gratitude to God, our Millionaires, our president, our president, our president, Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the determination of our government," he said.
"we will look at the impact of this incident and go ahead with it."
We live with the constant blow and never be right.
Ahead of our very ambitious goals.
This coup attempt did not shake up its economy.
Chaos and once again, those who are waiting for the crisis.
Our democracy today is at the feet of our economy.
Banking sector, our financial sector continues to work in a healthy way.
Foreign trade deficit in 2015 has fallen by 25 percent in glory.
The current account deficit for the national debt is 5.8 per cent in 2014, while the figure has dropped to 4.5 percent in 2015.
Aim to lower the 4 at the end of this year.
We will never change our tight hearing in the public finances.
The 2016 budget is also more than the national revenue of 130 countries.
With over 11 per cent of the budget deficit, the proportion of the national debt has dropped to 1.3 per cent in 2015, and we strive to maintain these rates.
Public debt from the EU, better than many countries in the world.
Solid ground in our banking financial sector.
"despite the fact that the central banks did not need to exchange foreign currency on the 15th of July, and there was not any reduction in our reserves, there were more than $121 billion in gross reserves," he said.
With the development of the economy, increased production and any ease for new employment areas, the prime minister said, "We also have comprehensive arrangements for you to save your load for the past."
Since the pardon is more than tape and a renewed convenience of unpaid tax liabilities, we have to implement many of the arrangement until the installment is implemented, we continue to pass.
"if you continue to produce for the country, continue to rely on your country, your government will continue to remove the obstacles in your way," he said.

The 15 July process showed how robust dynamics the Turkish economy has in society and how to drink democracy.
"it is clear that the next process for a society in which the economy and democracy and democracy is achieving this level will be better and faster."
"KS FOR Some SIKINGERS" to get rid of the laser

Referring to the recent interest rate cuts launched by banks recently, Olive said, "My real sector is 64th% of the land of the first five face of interest and if we do all we should concentrate on that job."

"one of the most recent decisions is that one of the most recent decisions will be given to exporters; we now finish the regulation of the economy ministry, and we will give our exporters a privileged green passport, representing around 20,000 exporters, as of the first figures," he said.
"coup GNIGHT AGAINST THE FINANCIAL SYSTEIN SYSTEM"
"but behind us, we now have to look at our aversion," Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek said, referring to OHAL, which declared the coup d'Ã©tat on 15 July and declared afterwards.
The two simple reasons have been declared OHAL, Simsek said, adding that "those who have attempted this coup must be removed from the state, and this process works; but more importantly, serious administrative reforms are needed to avoid a further coup attempts."
Is also needed for these administrative reforms as a climate, declared a State of Emergency, and so far, very serious structural reforms.

"I think Turkey's democracy has not solidified the foundations of democracy; because you look at the root of the problems of the recent past, you'll see that this betrayal ring is over.
"thus cleaning up the state of this terrorist organisation will strengthen Turkey's democracy, which in this era is shut down in Turkey," he said.
The fundamentals of the economy are generally solid, and they have never been wasted, returning to normal structural reform agendas, he said, adding that "Turkey has a return to its agenda, structural reforms progress."
Structural reforms are already unavoidable; because in the world of populism, protectionism is on the rise.
"Turkey but can prepare for the future by reform," he said.
Finally, he stressed that Turkey would not be cut off from the West, adding: "from time to time, our western allies may disagree with our friends; but Turkey is not cut off from the West, the European Union is not giving up."

Should download an Olympic spirit, and Heathrow should be expanded to
Heathrow will offer renovation and prosperity not only in our local communities and in London, but also across the country.
I think this is the incredible effort of all the nation and regions to benefit from the Games as it is in London 2012, which will make Heathrow a pretty attractive destination.
Great advantages for the Olympics, Stratford and the East End.
And Heathrow is close to creating opportunities for local people and companies to do it again.
With only 10,000 new internships available for our local communities, 40,000 new jobs will be created and we will not leave unemployed young people around the airport.
As London is ahead of 2012, the struggle to expand Heathrow will also be more challenging.
He told me that he can never be prepared for the games and that we will be the whole world.
Those doubts were wrong in 2012, and will be seen in the wrong on Heathrow.
There would always be obstacles which must be overcome but Heathrow answered all the questions that were asked.
Olympics as in Heathrow is not just a few people, but an infrastructure project for many people.
Expanding the expansion, 150,000 new jobs and an opportunity to create 211 billion pounds of economic growth and many skills and jobs both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
Heathrow has been named the best airport terminal in the world for over five years (in the rear of T2), up to T2, with a wonderful team that has introduced an infrastructure investment of 11 billion pounds in time and budget for the two most congested roads in the world.
Now we are ready to offer a third track, supported with 16 billion pounds worth of private investment.
The London 2012 Games was a great success for the United Kingdom, and there is no doubt that Heathrow is expanding.
This Olympic spirit is directed to expand Heathrow to secure our commercial future, and we will be proud of the fact that a great number of skills and business allow us to create the time.

Block Plus, Facebook advertising block "like a game of cat and mouse
He attempts to block the advertising block software for companies that make money from online advertising, and according to one of the companies who made the software, "cat-mouse play."
On Thursday, just two days after announcing that it would block Facebook's advertising block, Block Plus issued a blog that said its users could update their filters to avoid advertisements in social networks.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would alter codes around the ads to make it more difficult for advertisers to identify which portion of the page is advertising.
However, Block now says that the new code has been solved.
In a blog posting, Block spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this is an advanced battle between employees to block open source advertising and prevent them from being invented by advertising, since this is an advanced back battle between employees, and Facebook is possible to produce its own resolution in close time.
With the entry into this battle of the world's largest social media company, the advertising block shows how big a concern is for the industry.
Last year, an estimated 200 million people globally use advertising for advertising; this is four times the number of people using this type of software in 2013, according to a study by Pageously and Nielsen.
Facebook has access to mobile apps with 1.03 billion daily active users and mobile ads now account for 84 percent of Facebook advertising revenue.
A spokesperson for the mobile advertising block says the social network for Facebook is no effective in mobile applications and, in the company of the advertising block, has fallen.
Facebook is worth the investment of such a move, according to the advertisements, which should still provide sufficient income.
Once again, on Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update the vehicle "advertising preferences" so that people can better control the advertisements offered to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that the new filter, which is worrying about the Block, would block a portion of the content in the site.
"we do not offer a good experience to these people and we are planning to deal with this problem," a Facebook spokesman said in an e-mail.
The advertising block is a blind tool, so in order to give people the control, the advertising is focused on creating such vehicles.
Ran a woman into the Swiss highway; the incident appears to be suicide
The victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
Police in the case, which looked like suicide, hit a couple of cars on the highway in the early hours of Thursday, searching for people who were plural.
The incident occurred in A1, near Morges, just after midnight Thursday.
Vaud police said the woman was in a "desperate" place when the woman was in the darkness of the night and a few cars crashed into him.
The 49-year-old Swedish woman, who is clearly in charge of killing himself, has hit a few vehicles, including the truck.
Himself died at the scene.
Police said some of the drivers, who were involved in the incident, had been discussed but some said they had not been identified and asked everyone who was involved in their case and asked for them.
In a statement, Gilles Hofstetter, the lawyer for Le Tribune, said in a statement that it "opened a criminal prosecution as a logical" step in such cases. "
But it is not yet known whether the drivers, who were involved in the incident, will face any charges.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
This is supposed to identify the prosecutor, "said Hofstetter.
Over the last five years, two similar cases have shown that drivers would not be held responsible.
The newspaper reported that in both cases (both in the dark, a person was driving a toll road), the drivers were not expecting the driver to cross the highway in the middle of the night when the verdict was normal.
Last year he was found not guilty on charges of causing death due to the negligence of a police officer who left a man lying on the road near the A1 in August 2014.
Court, said the 22-year-old victim was drinking and was leaked on the road.
In response to an emergency call, the court found that the police officer used the tool in a reasonable manner and found a man on the road was "totally exceptional and unpredictable."
Those who had knowledge of this incident, which took place near Morges on Thursday, should seek police from 021 644, 46 or 021 644, from the top phones.
NASA climate model: Venus was once the place to live
The new NASA climate model estimates that once in life, Venus had appropriate conditions.
The scientists at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore the past of Venus using similar tools and hormones that are used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus is home to conditions similar to those in the world at once, with its warm, nonviolent surface and atmosphere filled with CO2.
In the past, scientists have been unable to explain the low return pace of Venus with a layer of thick atmosphere.
The newest estimates, however, are that, when Venus is thin, the world may have had a similar atmosphere and may still be able to slow down.
The model also looked at the topography of the old Venus.
The planet is more dry in the world than the world exists but once enough water and geographical volatility may have been to protect against rapid evaporation.
Old Venus, at the same time, was taking advantage of a 30 percent more unpleasant sun.
In a news release, GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a news release that the "GISS model simulates the slow return of Venus every time for almost two months to the day the sun is looking to the sun."
This is reflected in the surface of the earth by acting like an umbrella that protects against the sun from the thick cloud layers that cause the rain.
As a result, today the world is only a few degrees more cold than the average climate temperatures.
The model provided the creation of a story similar to the evolution that had previously been put forward by the planet scientists for Venus.
Although no matter how much life was once in accordance with conditions on Venus, a few billion years in the process was too much to bite and to be exposed.
The ocean was evaporated, and the water was burned with no steam to the ground.
Hydrogen has been sold out and left behind only with the deadly greenhouse gas effect of carbon dioxide that has remained in a thick atmosphere; that is, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in a Geophysical Research article.
Patrick Roy has resigned from the Avalanche antenna
Patrick Roy said the team has been in the process of making the decision, citing the Colorado Avalanche coach on Thursday and the vice president of hockey operations.
Joe Sakic, Colorado's executive vice president / general manager, has approved this development and said the club will start looking for new coaches immediately.
Roy, 50, said, "Over the past three years, I have been the principal instructor and vice president of hockey operations in Colorado Avalanche, fulfilling my energy, passion and determination."
I needed this team over the course of the summer by giving the depth of how I could improve further and how I thought I would be able to get to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the ram and VP hockey operations must be in perfect harmony with the vision of the company.
He also has the right to say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
In the current case, these conditions have not yet been met.
Roy joined the crew on May 23, 2013, for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick today informed me of his decision," Sakic said.
Thank him for everything that he has done for our company and we wish him plenty of luck in the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best defending champion in the league in his first season in 2013-14.
He scored 112 points in the club and secured the team's first finish in the league but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the first round of the playoff period and missed the games after the season in both years.
Avalanche has a 39-4 goal in 2015 and 16 in the Western Conference, five points less than for the second poker space.
In honour of goalkeeper Roy, two of the Montreal Canadiens won four Stanley Cup, including Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks by suspending the strike
North Sea oil workers have been suspended from the strike due to the fee, and the top negotiators have begun discussions for a new round of talks.
The strike against the oil field services company Wood Group operated by Royal Dutch Shell is gradually carried out on platforms in the North Sea.
"we have decided to restart the process for resolving the current dispute with Wood Group and as RMT unions," a joint statement said.
Over the next few weeks, we will be holding a series of meetings all day to introduce a new perspective on the problems beginning next week.
Labour unions have said that this protest against wage cuts, which could reach 30 per cent, is the first actions since 25 years.
Wood Group has cut nearly 9 per cent in payments to contractors in the North Sea this year due to negative pressures in the market.
The company has also implemented a 10 per cent price reduction to shore contractors in 2014, following the process of reducing this fee.
The company said additional cuts would provide space for the company to recover from the stressful period in the market.
Shell has cut its operations in the process of a merger with British energy company BG Group, which has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to lay off oil and gas operations in the country by up to 10 percent.
The energy companies are under pressure due to the low crude oil prices, an economic situation in which a decision was made to leave the European Union in June.
Dave Kerr, a member of parliament, met with workers leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest worker conflicts in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as he was quoted as saying, is vital to the regional economy.
"we need an effective economy for the majority, not for the minority across the North Sea and across the country," he said.
Despite an average of nearly $7 billion in investment over the last five years, it is expected that in 2016, less than $1.4 billion will be invested in new projects in the North Sea.
Kepler has measured the pace of return of stars in the Ulker team
The Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers with the latest mission to create the most complete catalogue in terms of the return of stars in the Ulker team of stars.
With the new data, astronomers have shown that the number of stars in the sky has returned to variable speed and return periods are helping to understand the interest with the composition of the planet.
Luisa Reeves, a research scientist at Caltech Center for Work and Analysis in Pasadena, Calif., said in a news release, "When we compare our results to star clusters, we hope to learn more about the relationship between stars, age and even the history of the solar system.
Ultimately, the team star swept 445 light years away.
The team of stars in most of the stars has become 125 million years ago, and access to the new level of new access.
Lives that may be at their highest rate of return.
Peak in return, this maturity phase stars a large amount of star wind.
These winds have progressed in the magnetic fields of stars as the effect of breaking on the stars.
The rate of return as a star starts to drop.
Kepler said the speed of return of each of the stars can make the difference, such as the sun, by measuring the time between the outlook of the star.
The latest return rates catalogue suggests that the larger stars are returned faster than the smaller stars.
Practically speaking, the stars are the big ones who are likened to the dancers only on their way to the small to more slowly carried out.
"we see that those who return to the locker room are much more severe, faster than those who return," he said.
Ultimately the team star is very close to the star characteristics of the return with an ideal cosmic laboratory task.
"ultimately, the team stars as young and old as the theoretical models for star returns in both directions," he said.
Looking at the speed of the stars, how, when, and why, the one who fell to the plate in their dance shoes is one more thing we want to learn about.
The find and colleagues of the Ulker team stars with the newest analysis on the rates of return, which will soon be published in Astronomy Magazine as detailed in three new essays.
